00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 I am better than my viewers. Well actually the series name is I am better than my viewers,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,360
 but you know, it's fine. Welcome to episode 11 of I'm better than my viewers,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,840
 and the challenger this time is a guy called Flair, with a ratings of whopping 1852.

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,120
 G6, I'm obviously threatening H7 checkmate in one, so if he can just blunder it right now,

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:32,080
 that will be very convenient. Of course he sees it. At least I win a knight. I mean having an

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:39,200
 evaluation of -16 against an 1850 is not really a situation that I want to be in, but I can still

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:46,480
 see that there are chances for me to turn the table. Knight takes F6. F5. I mean what else

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:55,920
 can I do anyway, and good luck finding that checkmate in 21. Dude. He's actually spending

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:04,480
 time to find it. Ha. Noob. I really want to take that pawn back, but blundering this pawn also

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,040
 doesn't seem to be a good idea, so I guess, I have to check here. In a perfect world, he'll go king

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:19,760
 takes G7, H6 check, king takes H6 and then I'll have a wife. I guess I'm maidenless. G takes.

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:28,160
 King takes. H6. Man now I realize that even though I have a lot of pawns, most of them are so useless

13
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,800
 because it takes too many moves to push them forward and make them actually show their value

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:41,120
 on the chessboard. B takes A2. Ah ha, I think he wants to say that now it is his turn to attack.

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:50,160
 G5. No, it is still my turn, I'm the attacker here. And then he says no, it is his turn,

16
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:59,200
 but again, no, it's still my turn. Okay fine it's his turn. King takes A2 is forced. Now don't tell

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,880
 me that he's gonna see the entire checkmate in 10 and absolutely humiliate me in front of my views.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,680
 Ha, of course not. C takes B4. I mean I was supposed to say that blunders a horsey,

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,160
 but I think we all know very clearly that losing a horsey is nothing much right now.

20
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:26,240
 Knight takes B4 check. King B1. No worries, it's very hard to checkmate with only knights,

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:34,400
 even to an 1800. Well but it's not that hard to take all the pawns with those knights. King C1.

22
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,000
 Knight back to B3 check. Ah ha, I don't know if he's offering a draw by repetition,

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,760
 but if I trust him and go king B1, there is actually knight A3 check B takes A3 knight

24
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,080
 C3 check king B2 is forced knight B A4 checkmate in 3, and even though I didn't see that checkmate

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,280
 in 3 during the game, I did know for sure that going back to B1 was very dangerous,

26
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,480
 and I also don't think I can trust him for making a repetition draw, therefore, king D1. At least I

27
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,360
 calculated that my king will be able to move to the other side and stay safe behind the pawns

28
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:20,480
 for a couple of moves. Knight B2 king E1 knight C2 king F1 knight D2 king G1. Ha, guess what,

29
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:28,960
 there's no more check, unless he goes knight C3 knight E2. C3. Ah ha, he's obviously aiming to

30
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:38,560
 get a wife, therefore, I need to make progress right now. E4. Knight E1. E takes F5. Alright,

31
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:48,320
 let's see who's better, your C pawn or my 5 pawns. Knight D7. Ah ha, I can see, that he's getting

32
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:56,720
 scared. He will 100% sacrifice his knight if I play F6, therefore, G6. It's very rare to see

33
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,040
 someone getting scared that they'll lose when Stockfish is saying that they have a checkmate

34
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,240
 in 16. F takes G6. I'll take this way, the grandmasters always say that you should take

35
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:13,360
 towards the center, but this time is absolutely different because there are some very hungry

36
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,640
 horses in the middle of the board. King G8. And then at this very moment, I realized that no matter

37
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:27,200
 how hard I try, there is no way I can make a queen unless he blunders it real hard. But well, let's

38
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:37,440
 just try our luck. H7 check. King takes G7 is forced. H6 check. How about king takes H6? Nevermind.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,320
 Random move go. G4. C2. And in this position, I realized that he only needs one move to get a

40
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,240
 woman, and since I didn't have any women in this game, I cannot allow him to have one, therefore,

41
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,080
 I resigned. But even though this guy have one and I should be saying I'm better than my viewers but

42
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,800
 this guy and only this guy is equal to me, there is actually a very big plot twist here. You see,

43
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,240
 this is actually the second game that I recorded with this guy, and for why this is the second

44
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,800
 game, it's because in the first game, after my G6, he actually went for B takes A2, which obviously

45
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,640
 blunders H7 checkmate in one with a pawn, and then he said brah, even though I should be the one who

46
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,760
 say that instead of him, so then I felt bad for him and I also couldn't just make a video with

47
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,760
 only one move featuring a freaking 1800 blundering his king at the very first move of a chess game.

48
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,280
 I decided to play a second game like you've just watched, therefore, I won the first game,

49
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,600
 he won the second game, so it was a draw, which is to say, that I'm better than my viewers.

50
00:05:45,600 --> 00:06:00,240
