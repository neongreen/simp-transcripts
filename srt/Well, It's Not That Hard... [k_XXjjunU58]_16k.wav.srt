00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 100 rated chess, but you obey the church. Your pieces and pawns can only move to the

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,680
 same square color as the most recently moved bishop. Very challenging.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:22,480
 C3. Aha! Long time no see, the Sarago-Sa opening. E5. There has been no bishop move yet,

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:31,520
 so let's just assume that we can make any moves that we want. Knight F3. Perfect. E4. Free tempos

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,400
 are really important because if I can make a good amount of development before he can develop his

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:47,280
 bishop, the game would become much easier. Knight E5. Very aggressive. D6. E3. That blunders a

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,040
 horsey. Now that he's opened up his light square bishop, I need to find a way to move my dark

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,640
 square bishop, because once he moves his light bishop, my dark bishop won't be able to move for

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,640
 an eternity. Wow, as soon as I need to move my bishop, he gives me the most convenient target

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:16,000
 possible. Bishop takes A3. He's not a paid actor by the way. B takes A3. Alright, now that there

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,760
 is a bishop move on the board, the challenge has officially begun. Knight F6. Queen A4 check.

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:33,600
 Oh. I totally did not see that coming. King F8 is kinda forced. It's fine, his queen is only

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,560
 dangerous if she's in the middle of the board, but that is obviously impossible right now.

14
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,240
 Nevermind. That blunders a queen, but since she's on a light square, I cannot take her due to the

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,640
 rules. Queen D6. Now don't tell me that he's gonna take this pawn and then my rook as well.

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:04,080
 Yeah you better run away you coward. H6. A4. G5. Never gonna give his queen up.

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,640
 Queen H5. That blunders the queen again, but again, that is a light square, so I still cannot

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:21,040
 take it. King G7. The plan is simple. Rook D8, bishop moves, queen takes D2 checkmate.

19
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:30,720
 Queen H3. That still blunders the queen, but again, it's a light square. Rook D8. At this

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,840
 point, I'm getting scared that he might already find out what I'm doing right now and is just

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:44,960
 trying to mock me. Nevermind. Now that really blunders the woman. G takes. I'll take this

22
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:51,920
 bishop too. Ha! Perfect situation, now just go bishop B2 and there should be some sketchy

23
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,600
 checkmate for me. Or not. I really want to take that pawn and go F3, but since the last bishop

24
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,720
 move was a light square bishop, I cannot disrespect the rules. Therefore, knight E4. Okay.

25
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:16,000
 Now you can blunder your king. It's fine. Queen C2. I'm attacking your bishop, how about moving

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,720
 it away? G takes H6 check. King H7 is kinda forced. King E2. That blunders a checkmate in 4 of knights

27
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:35,120
 C3 check. King F2. Queen F5 check. King E1. Queen F3. D takes C3 and rook D1 checkmate, but sadly,

28
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,680
 the very first move is already blundering the challenge. So I guess, let's bring in more pieces.

29
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:50,480
 No need to rush, he will eventually have to move his bishop. Ha! There it is. Queen takes D2 check.

30
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,040
 King F3. Queen F2 King E4 and F5 checkmate is obviously the best continuation since it is also

31
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:07,360
 a checkmate with a pawn, but sadly, F5 is a light square move, which is against the rules. Knight G5.

32
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,800
 To be honest I actually still don't see any other checkmates, but I guess it will eventually happen

33
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:20,320
 anyway. King G4. And since we don't have much time left, let's get the video faster to match the

34
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:28,880
 tension of the game. Queen takes E3. King H5. Queen F4. Rook A G1. Queen F6. Let's just flag him down.

35
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,800
 Rook takes G5. Queen takes H6 and his time runs out. Mission accomplished.

36
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:51,280
