00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 I'm better than my viewers, is this fair? Yeah, it's fair for white. Welcome to another episode

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,120
 of I'm better than my viewers, and today's challenger is a guy called Shadownights297.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:22,240
 Bishop takes c5. Man, it's only been one move into the game, and I already don't know what to do.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:31,120
 Let's take it this way. Just like the grandmasters say, always capture toward the center. Bishop

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:39,280
 takes c5. Again, capture toward the center. Bishop takes. It seems like he really hates the dark

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,480
 square bishops. D takes. Huh. Guess what, now taking this pawn is not sacrificing the last

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:54,400
 dark square bishop. Rook takes g5. G takes. Alright, inviting the first woman to come in.

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,520
 Queen takes g5. F6. I think his best choice should be to take this pawn,

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,600
 but does he have the guts to take it though?

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,720
 Ha! Coward. c4. And I've just realized, that I've blundered g6.

11
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,200
 Yeah. This game is so dead. Taking that bishop is just blundering queen g6 queen h5 checkmate in 2.

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,680
 So I guess. F7. Bishop h5. G6. Alright, at least this will help for a while.

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:42,320
 Nevermind. F takes g6. Bishop takes e6. Wow. He actually saw that by moving his bishop,

14
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,440
 he opened up the way for his rook to pin this pawn to my king, so if I take his bishop now,

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:54,720
 he can go queen g6 queen g1 queen g8 and there is no way I can stop it. So I guess, king g7.

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:05,600
 Rook h7. I'll take that. Not sure about that one man. Queen g1. Ah ha, now I can take this bishop.

17
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:14,000
 Bishop g5. Alright, so in this very position, I realized that there is no way I can win anymore,

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 so I offered a draw, and of course, he accepted it. So I guess. I'm better than my viewers.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:36,240
