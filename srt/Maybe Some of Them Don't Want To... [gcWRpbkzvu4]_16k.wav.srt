00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 100 rated chess, but you must promote 7 pawns into queens.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,120
 Well, I'm pretty sure some of them won't want to change their gender,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,080
 but of course, I make the decision here. We get a 183 from India. So the best plan is obviously to

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,440
 not push any pawns forward to avoid them dead, but sadly, I'm not a coward. If I lose, I lose.

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,640
 D6. Not very aggressive. D4. Alright, these are the only 2 pawns that I'm gonna push.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,160
 If these guys die, I won't have enough 7 pawns to promote, which means the video ends.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,680
 Queen D7. Dude, I can't believe he actually pushed his pawn just to create a square for

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:55,040
 his queen to move forward. Bishop C4. Knight F6. Dude. Somehow this guy decided to lift his queen

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,240
 up, and then just leave her there blocking his bishop. Knight C3. In no world do you take Edward

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:12,400
 right now. Of course. Knight F3. Bishop E7. D5. I mean C6 will create a lot of trouble,

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,600
 but it's not like he's gonna play it anytime soon. Nevermind. Alright. I have to take it.

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:28,320
 It's fine, I still have enough pawns for this game. David is dead. Man. Maybe the entire idea

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:37,520
 of pushing pawns forward was a massive disaster. Queen E2. Alright, change of plan. All, eyes,

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,040
 on, Edward, and at least with this plan, I can keep him alive for a couple more moves.

15
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:52,640
 Well. Even though I have to end the video right now, since it is still so short, I'll answer some

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,920
 of your comments instead. Never overestimate 200 elo. But if I underestimate them, the people in

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,040
 the comments are gonna go like, "How dare you disrespect your opponent?" "Everyone deserves

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,920
 to be respected, disliked and subbed reported to YouTube." "Sir, you just have no idea how tough it

19
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,240
 is to be a YouTuber." "Bad video, you should've reverted to the original challenge if you failed

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,960
 because you increased the difficulty yourself." "Aha, you must be new to the channel, let's just

21
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:32,000
 say. I'm not a coward." "Why do you still not know how to checkmate with bishop and knight?

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Surely it can't be that hard." Well.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:50,800
