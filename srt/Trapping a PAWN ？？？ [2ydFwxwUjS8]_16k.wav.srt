00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 100 rated chess, but you need to trap every type of piece. And pawn, at least once.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,440
 Okay the first thing I know is that this video is definitely going to be long,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:21,920
 but I don't know if it'll be a successful one. We get a 1 24 from India. E4. E6. Aha. Here we go.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:31,920
 E5. Ha. I trapped his pawn. D6. He takes D6. I mean the biggest challenge is obviously trying

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,040
 to trap his queen, so if he can just bring his queen out right now. Nevermind. D4. I bet you

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,640
 everything I have that he'll play queen A5 next. Absolutely. Blocking with the bishop is just

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,040
 chasing the queen back to her home, therefore, knight C3. I mean since he only has 1 queen,

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,480
 I cannot take it before I trap it, so in no world do you take my horsey right here.

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:10,960
 G6. Bishop D2. H5. Very aggressive. Knight B5. Alright, first attempt, I'm attacking his queen,

10
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,840
 and even though queen D8 defending the fork is the best move, there is a chance that he'll go

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:25,440
 queen A4 instead, which then allows B3, trapping the queen. Well, I mean just leaving the queen

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,080
 there to death is also an option. D5. I don't know, I guess controlling more squares in his

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,000
 territory is not a bad idea, and spoiler alert, this D5 move is actually a brilliant move that

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,160
 will have a crucial affection in the later gameplay, so if you want to play along with

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:50,880
 me in the video, I suggest you pay attention to that pawn. David. Queen takes B5. It's fine.

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,000
 C4. Alright, I'm sacrificing this pawn to bring the queen closer for more chance at trapping it.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,640
 Well, I mean at least she got closer. Rook C1. Again, even though he's blundering his woman

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:15,680
 multiple times, I can not take her before I trap her. Queen G4. Knight F3. Queen E4 check.

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,000
 Very aggressive. Bishop E3 allowing my queen to defend David should be the best move,

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:32,800
 but actually, I have a better idea. Bishop E2. Please take my pawn. Thank you. Rook takes C8

21
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:41,360
 check. King D7. Queen C2. Nothing much, I'm just defending my rook, there's absolutely no suspicious

22
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:52,880
 intention here. Bishop G7. Ladies and gentlemen, we did it. Bishop C4. That queen is trapped.

23
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:01,120
 Let's see. Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

24
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:14,400
 Queen A5. Still dead. Alright, next stop, the rooks. Bishop H6. Bishop D5. A6. That blunders

25
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,080
 a king, but of course we cannot do that yet. Bishop E6. King E7. Well I guess it will always

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,800
 be possible to checkmate the king at this state of the game. Bishop takes B7. And with that,

27
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:38,080
 his rook is trapped. Bishop F4. I'll take the rook. Bishop H6. Okay so let's talk about this

28
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,040
 for a moment. The remaining targets are the knights and the bishop, but the entire idea of

29
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,480
 trapping a minor piece is actually more difficult than it seems, because for most of the time,

30
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,520
 they can just take one of the pieces that are trying to trap them for a trade, or may as well

31
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:59,440
 just take a pawn and make a sacrifice. So to be fair, I suggest we just ignore the trapping knight

32
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:05,200
 and bishop part, as that can easily be made into an entire video, and I also don't have much time

33
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:13,120
 left on the clock. Therefore, bishop D8 king E6 bishop D5 sacrificing king takes D5 queen C4.

34
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,200
 The king is trapped. Mission kinda accomplished.

35
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:31,980
