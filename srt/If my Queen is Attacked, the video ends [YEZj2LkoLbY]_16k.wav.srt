1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
 If your queen is attacked, the video ends.

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:10,260
 Also, your queen must be beyond your pawn rank since move 2.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,660
 Well, at first thought, I think this is just too hard.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,460
 But then 2 days later, this guy also suggested, that if I play c4 and queen b3, there can

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,180
 be some chances.

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,740
 And to be honest, I think that's worth a shot.

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:34,380
 Therefore, let's find an opponent.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,940
 We get a 2 21 from Croatia.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,700
 Great!

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:46,260
 As I was planning to go c4 and queen b3, chess.com gave us the black pieces.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,020
 e4.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,420
 Well, I think we should still stick with our plan.

13
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,220
 c5.

14
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,460
 Knight f3.

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,060
 Move e6.

16
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,320
 Ok.

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,420
 Come at me baby!

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,780
 d4.

19
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,220
 He's totally coming at me.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,940
 Now c takes d4 should be the best move, but doing that will allow queen takes d4, which

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,100
 attacks my queen, therefore ends the video.

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,340
 But still, if I just leave it like this, he may decide to take my pawn on his next move,

23
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,180
 which also attacks my queen, and also ends the video.

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,780
 Therefore, c4.

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,780
 b3.

26
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,740
 I'll take that, there's nothing can attack my queen at the moment.

27
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,580
 a takes.

28
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,740
 I need to develop some pieces.

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,860
 d6.

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,420
 Bishop e3.

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,300
 Aha!

32
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:58,860
 He's obviously trying to end this video, by pushing his pawn.

33
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,200
 And sadly, it seems like there is no good way to defend it.

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,460
 So I guess, d5.

35
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,520
 Losing a pawn, is much better, than losing a video.

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,820
 e takes d5.

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,500
 Knight f6.

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,100
 d6.

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,740
 Very aggressive.

40
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:26,420
 He's obvious once again threatening to go d5, which ends the video.

41
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:30,340
 Therefore, knight d5.

42
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,140
 c4.

43
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,540
 I have to take this bishop.

44
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,300
 He should be able to see, that he needs to take back my knight, not counterattacking

45
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:46,180
 my queen, because if he attacks my queen, I can go queen before check, queen d2 blocking

46
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:53,620
 the check, queen takes d2 check, knight takes d2, knight f5, getting away from danger.

47
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,460
 Right?

48
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,100
 Yep, he saw it.

49
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,940
 But now what?

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,940
 The threat is obviously c5, and there's no square for my queen that cannot be attacked.

51
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:14,580
 Alright, I guess I have no choice, but to go for my biggest chance of survival.

52
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,620
 Queen before check.

53
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,940
 Please block with your horsey.

54
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,180
 I'm so going to have a heart attack right now.

55
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,420
 Thank you.

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,420
 Bishop g4.

57
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,020
 Oh, wait.

58
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,260
 I blundered.

59
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,580
 Please don't play it.

60
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,620
 Yes.

61
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,820
 I'll take his horsey.

62
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,280
 He should be able to see, that rook a4 is blundering a rook now.

63
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
 He saw it.

64
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,500
 But now, rook a4 is once again the threat.

65
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,540
 And sadly, there's no way for me to avoid that.

66
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,940
 So I guess, let's just take a pawn.

67
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,180
 I mean the move rook a4 doesn't look that good anyway.

68
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,860
 d5.

69
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,500
 Oh, that's actually good for me.

70
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,900
 Queen c5.

71
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:25,180
 Ha ha, now there is absolutely no moves that can attack.

72
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:25,460
 What the f-

73
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:40,060
