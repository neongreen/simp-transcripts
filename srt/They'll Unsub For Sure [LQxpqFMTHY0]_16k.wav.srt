00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 100 rated chess, but you are playing as Spain vs Costa Rica, you must capture 7 of your

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,480
 opponent's pieces or pawns, without losing any of your pieces or pawns. Well, I guess I'm losing

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,960
 subs from Costa Rica. We get a 268 from the US. Knight f3. Pushing center pawns is obviously too

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,080
 risky. So I guess, knight f6. Taking 7 different pieces or pawns is a very difficult task,

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,840
 so if he can just play e4 or g4 blundering a pawn right now. That will be very convenient.

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:46,720
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. Knight takes g4. Alright, 1 down, 6 to go.

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:55,040
 Bishop h3. Aha, so normally I would play h5 here so that if he takes my knight I can open up my

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,000
 rook. But just for this game, I have to retreat it. Knight c3 b6 b3 not very aggressive bishop

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,640
 e7 bishop a3 g6 d4 bishop g7. Nothing wrong so far. Knight e4. Aha, that blunders a horsey.

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,760
 But do I want to take it though, because if I take his horsey, he may feel bad about losing

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:26,240
 an entire piece, which may lead to an instant resignation. You know what? I'm not a coward.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,280
 At the end of the day, I mean who resigns from the game just because of a single horsey anyway.

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:42,160
 Right? No doubt. Castle. Queen d3. Aha, that queen technically cannot take my knight because

14
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,760
 my bishop is defending it, but based on my experience, you can never trust the 100 rated

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,000
 guys to notice that. Therefore, I'll move my knight back. No need to rush, I only need to

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,800
 sit here and wait for my opponent to make mistakes. Knight e5. That blunders a rook,

17
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,160
 and even though taking it is very risky because it can lead to a resignation, I need to make

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:11,600
 progress. Beginners don't tend to use their rooks very often, so I don't think that he'll resign

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,040
 just because of a rook, and as long as he doesn't take anything too crazy, this challenge is still

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,880
 very doable. What the f-
