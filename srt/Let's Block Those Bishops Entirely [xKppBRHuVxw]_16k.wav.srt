 100 rated chess, but if your bishop sees a piece or pawn that wasn't originally on that bishop's

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,440
 color square, the video ends. Very challenging, and since trading off the bishops will make the

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:22,800
 challenge too easy, let's just say that my bishops must not die. F4. Opening up the bishops obviously

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,040
 doesn't seem to be a good idea, therefore, the best plan is obviously to never push any of these pawns.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,400
 Knight c6. C4. Alright, that's pretty much all of the center pawns that I can use.

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:46,720
 A5. Very aggressive. Knight c3. A4. Aha, A3 is gonna start a fight with my b-pawn,

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,400
 and since my b-pawn has a very important task of blocking my bishop's view, I cannot allow that to

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:01,840
 happen. Therefore, A3. You know what they say, better be safe than pregnant. Knight d4. Aha,

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,200
 that knight now blocks the only square that I can develop my queen to, and even though knight f3 is

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,400
 available, knight takes will force me to take back with one of these pawns, which is obviously not

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,680
 good for the video, not to mention that I also don't want to trade pieces when I'm being down

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,960
 2 bishops. So I guess, I'll develop my rook first. H4. This knight started on a dark square,

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,200
 so knight takes e2 will make my light square bishop seize his dark square knight,

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,920
 which ends the video, but I mean who plays like that anyway. Right?

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,920
 Of course. That blunders a pawn, and if he can just blunder his queen too, that will be very

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:50,720
 convenient. I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. That blunders a woman, and now he

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,760
 should be able to see, that my knight is threatening to take his c-pawn with a fork, so there's

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:04,240
 absolutely no time to play a move like knight take c2 to end my video. Right? There we go,

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,960
 that blunders a bishop and a rook, and even though I obviously should go for the rook because my

20
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,880
 knight will 100% be able to go back, bishop takes g2 will actually force me to take his bishop,

21
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,760
 which then opens up my bishop's view, and then a move like knight back to c6 will make my light

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,000
 square bishop seize his dark square knight, which ends my video. Therefore, I have to take this

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,560
 bishop first. Okay, here's how the plan goes. Rook d3, knight c6, knight takes c7, checkmate.

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,960
 Knight b3. Aha, that knight now can take my bishop, which ends my video, so I guess a sacrifice

25
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,320
 should be made now in order to be safe, but as you can see here, he's also targeting my rook,

26
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:53,600
 so I have faith that he will take my rook instead of my bishop next move. Therefore,

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,000
 rook d3. In no world do you take my bishop here instead of my rook.

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,440
 Well, I guess not taking anything is also an option. But anyway, knight to c7,

29
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,000
 a beautiful horse checkmate with the rook locking down the king from a very far distance.

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,880
 Mission accomplished.

31
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:29,680
