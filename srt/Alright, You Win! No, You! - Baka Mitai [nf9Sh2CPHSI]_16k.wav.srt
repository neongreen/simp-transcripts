00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,860
 I love you.

7
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,580
 You don't even say it.

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,160
 I'm fed up with your words.

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:54,720
 But why did you have to say goodbye?

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:01,720
 It's no good, no good, no good.

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,720
 I love you, I love you too much.

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:14,720
 Even if I drink strong alcohol,

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:37,720
 I'll be stupid to remember you.

14
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,720
 I'm like an idiot. I'm really stupid.

15
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:50,720
 I just believe in you.

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,720
 I pretend to be a strong woman.

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 I bathe in the night wind of pain.

18
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,720
 Three years have passed since I became alone.

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,720
 The town has changed.

20
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:29,720
 But why did you leave only regrets?

21
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,720
 You're a really bad man.

22
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,720
 I'll take off your ring of prayer.

23
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,720
 I'll make a fuss.

24
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 I'm like an idiot waiting for you.

25
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:17,720
 I'm like an idiot waiting for you.

26
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,720
 It's no good, no good, no good.

27
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,720
 I love you, I love you too much.
