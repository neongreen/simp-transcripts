00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 I'm better than my viewers, power pawns. These names just don't make any sense.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,040
 But anyway, ladies and gentlemen and people somewhere in the middle,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,400
 welcome to another I'm better than my viewers video, and today's challenger is a guy called

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,320
 Average Masochist Cullen, with a rating of whopping 2200 rapid. And don't worry,

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,160
 that word doesn't get demonetized. I'll take this pawn first. Retreating the king on the

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,080
 very first move is obviously too cowardly of an action. And you know what, I guess I'll just

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,200
 keep my king on this very same square and not going to retreat him for even a single time in

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:50,080
 this entire game, like how a real man plays his game of chess. D6. King f4. Knight d5 check. King

9
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:58,960
 g3. Queen g8. Ah ha. As you can see, Stockfish didn't like that move very much, and since I am

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,760
 always the nicest guy in the entire world, I asked my opponent, "Do you want to remove?" I'm offering

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,920
 my opponent a free takeback, because I also don't like gaining advantages too early into the game,

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:17,760
 but then he said, "Nah. I will win anyway so giving away a little bit doesn't matter,

13
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:26,640
 winky face. This guy is so dead." Queen f5. Forking two things, can only save one.

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:37,120
 He saved the fat one. Queen takes f7. Bishop f6. That blunders a pawn. Queen takes rook takes

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,600
 rook takes. Rook f8. Knight c7 would have been checkmate if it wasn't because of this knight.

16
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,960
 Therefore, rook f5. I mean who knows, maybe he'll blunder bishop h4 check thinking that it creates

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,320
 a double attack on my king and my rook. Of course it doesn't happen. He's trying to create a free

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:09,440
 square for his king, but sadly that abandons this pawn. Knight f7. Rook d7. Knight d6. Ah ha. In

19
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,200
 this position, there is a very easy-to-see checkmate in 8 for white. So if you are interested,

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,440
 don't even care about it, because you won't ever find it anyway. Rook takes d6. I mean I missed

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,320
 the checkmate but it doesn't even matter because I'm too far ahead in materials right now. King b7.

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:36,320
 Very aggressive. This center knight is too strong. Rook sacrifice. Pawn takes knight b4 bishop d4.

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,560
 Ah ha. Unlike last time, this is just a simple checkmate in 5, so while I was using 5% of my

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,240
 brainpower to find the checkmate, I see the mate in 5 lol. For context, he said this sentence in

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,080
 like 3 seconds after making his move, so I had no choice but to spend the next 15 minutes thinking

26
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,480
 about the moves, and if you are also interested. This time, please feel free to pause the video

27
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,080
 to find this absolutely amazing checkmate, while I don't give you any seconds to do so because

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,560
 people skipped the video, and the answer is Rook d7 King down b7 King up knight c6 King a6 b pawn

29
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,280
 underpromotes with a check Rook takes Rook a7. Checkmate. I'm better than my viewers.
