00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 If a bishop goes to a long diagonal, simp names 5 things that are... long.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,400
 Man, this is so gonna get me demonetized. We get a 1 59 from Norway.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,560
 Well, if I win the challenge myself, I won't have to worry about monetizing stuff.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,520
 E4. For those of you who don't know, there are 2 long diagonals on the chess board that are red

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,760
 colored right now. Therefore, if a bishop ever lands on any of these red squares, I will have

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:40,320
 to say... long stuff. C5. I was hoping that he can develop his bishop normally for a trade.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:50,800
 But well, at least that doesn't harm the video. Knight F3. Knight C6. D4. C takes D4,

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,600
 knight takes D4. It's actually very rare to see a 100 rated guy knows about Sicilian theory like

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:06,160
 this, so maybe this guy is actually a smurf. Knight takes D4. Queen takes D4. This is actually

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,760
 good for me, since now G6 is not possible, and if G6 is not possible, there is also no bishop G7,

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,440
 which means the video doesn't end. And he immediately threatened the video,

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:27,440
 as soon as I think it cannot end. Wow! Now what do I do? I mean I have queen D5,

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,160
 but after rook B8, there's nothing stopping him from going bishop B7.

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:41,440
 Oh well, I guess I don't have any other choices. Queen D5, and now if he plays G6,

15
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:48,800
 I would say that this guy has a camera in my house. Queen A5 check. Very aggressive.

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,240
 But actually, that is good for me, since the video can be a little bit longer. Bishop D2,

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,120
 and in no world do you end my video here, or create another threat to end my video.

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:13,200
 This guy is absolutely destroying me right now. Alright, it's fine, now the video, is based on

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,800
 luck. That blunders a woman. So normally when a man loses his woman, he usually cannot keep calm,

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,960
 so let's just hope, that my opponent loses his mind, and play a random move like H5.

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:37,520
 Yeah, or that. Queen takes A8. Okay, this is good. Now bishop B7 is not possible anymore,

22
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,360
 and since I'm threatening queen takes C8 checkmate in 1,

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
 there is no way that he's developing his other bishop. Right?

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:55,840
 Aha! Yes. Queen takes C8. Checkmate. That was close.

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:10,480
