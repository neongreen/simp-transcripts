00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 100 rated chess, but Edward the E-pawn is the commander. None of your pieces, or pawns,

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,720
 can move past Edward. And he cannot die. We get a 100 rated guy from Turkey. I cannot move

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:23,200
 anything past my E-pawn, therefore, the first move has to be, an E-pawn move. E6. I really

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:29,280
 want to push E5 to expand how far my pieces can move around, but D6 and F6 are too much for me to

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:38,800
 handle at the moment. D4 instead. E5. That blunders a pawn, but David cannot move past Edward. Knight

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:54,080
 F3. E takes D4. I'll gambit. C3. D takes C3. Bishop C4. C6. Ah ha. Now D5 is forking my bishop and my

7
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,520
 E-pawn, and even though it normally loses a pawn, the situation is different this time.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,760
 C takes B2. Bishop takes B2. It's funny that I have 2 very strong bishops but they actually

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:18,720
 don't move very far. C5. Knight B D2. C4. That blunders a pawn, and this time I can take it.

10
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:28,560
 D5. Ah ha. Now I have to make a very important decision. Do I take this pawn? If I take this

11
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,800
 pawn, my pieces can advance to the 5th rank, but it also puts Edward in a very dangerous situation

12
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,600
 that my opponent can go crazy and decide to take this pawn. But who cares anyway. I mean what are

13
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:50,960
 the chances that he blunders his queen just to end my video right now? Right? No doubt. That blunders

14
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,960
 a bishop, but it most likely ends my video, I also don't want knight E3 because I'm pretty sure that

15
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,080
 he's gonna blunder his bishop into my Edward. So I guess, I only have one choice. Knight D6 check.

16
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,720
 Queen takes D6. Queen E2. This way my queen can pin his bishop into his king and my E pawn is

17
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,320
 still being defended by my bishop, and he should be able to see that queen takes D5 very obviously

18
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:32,000
 blundering a woman. Right? Ha. Doubters. But still this is very dangerous, so I guess, I should take

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,160
 a risk. I'm blundering my horsey, but this is a worthy risk as I'm trying to bait F6 attacking

20
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,440
 my knight so that I can finally advance my pawn forward and get everything back under my control.

21
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,640
 What the f-
