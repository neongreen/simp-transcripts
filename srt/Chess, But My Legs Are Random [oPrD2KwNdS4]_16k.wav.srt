1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 100 rated chess, but you use a random number generator for how many steps that your pieces

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,520
 or pawns have to move.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,960
 Number between 1 and 10.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,600
 Dude, for your information, the chess board is only 8x8.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,200
 So let's change it to 5.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,320
 Because let's take a look at this.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,000
 In H5, is only 4 squares in length, and even a max length bishop move, is only 1 2 3 4,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,320
 and 5 squares only.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,160
 Therefore, if I somehow roll an early 6 or bigger number, the mission is failed.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,900
 And with that out of the way, let's start the game.

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,760
 We get a 1 0 2 from Venezuela.

12
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,760
 Random.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
 2.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,440
 Oh, wait.

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,720
 On second thought, maybe I should have skipped the random first move, since if I had rolled

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,680
 a 4 or 5, the mission would have been failed.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,980
 But anyway, since I rolled a 2, e4.

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,480
 And by the way, let's make the knight's moves 2 squares as well.

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,840
 F6.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
 Random.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
 3.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,040
 The queen g4 is too risky, because if he plays things like d5, the RNGesus may not

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,160
 allow me to move the queen away from danger.

24
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,000
 Therefore, bishop c4.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,900
 Well, technically this move is not 3 squares in length, but to make things simpler, let's

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,600
 just ignore all of the excessive maths.

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,440
 D5.

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,560
 That blunders a pawn.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,680
 But if I don't roll a 1, 2, or 3, it's actually me blundering a bishop.

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,240
 Are you serious?

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,400
 Well I think it's actually fine, since I have a 60% chance of small number.

32
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,120
 Right?

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,080
 And I get a big number.

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,120
 Queen h5 is forced.

35
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,440
 G6.

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,300
 And now I'm being double attacked.

37
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,880
 This mission is going very wrong very quickly.

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,960
 2.

39
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,680
 Queen f3 is kinda forced.

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,600
 Knight h6.

41
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,520
 And he didn't even take my bishop.

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,360
 60%.

43
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,160
 4.

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,220
 Man, what is wrong with my 60%?

45
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,280
 Queen b3 is forced.

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,200
 Well at least if he takes my bishop now, his pawn will be attacking my queen, but I can

47
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,720
 still see there are a lot of safe squares for her to go.

48
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,480
 Bishop g4.

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,960
 Still denying my bishop.

50
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,240
 Again, 60%.

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,480
 Queen takes b7 is kinda forced.

52
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,440
 Well at least he won't take my bishop now, right?

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,360
 Knight a6.

54
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,040
 2.

55
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,400
 Finally.

56
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
 Bishop takes a6.

57
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
 Oh, wait.

58
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,360
 Maybe I shouldn't have done that, because rook d8 is very much likely going to win my

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,200
 queen.

60
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,520
 After ignoring my bishop for 3 moves, he loses a piece, and now he resigns.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,920
 But anyway.

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,640
 Mission, accomplished.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:47,560
 [Outro]
