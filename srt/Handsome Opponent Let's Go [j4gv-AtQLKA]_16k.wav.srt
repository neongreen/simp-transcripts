00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 100 rated chess, but you're a conqueror, your pieces, and pawns, must only die on your opponent's

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:15,120
 half of the board. Ha! Easiest challenge ever, we get a 130 from Lebanon, and I'll say that this guy

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,280
 is pretty handsome, E4 may have to face E5 and then my E pawn will stuck on my side of the board,

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,360
 which is not good because if he takes it, the video ends. Therefore, let's develop a knight

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,040
 first, I mean if he can go E5 and blunder his E pawn now, that will be very convenient.

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:43,760
 Of course it doesn't happen. E4. Queen E7. Very aggressive. E5, now Edward is officially in his

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:52,560
 half of the board, so I absolutely don't care if he dies or not. C6. D4. Nothing wrong so far.

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,480
 D5. Aha, now the French move is possible, but after queen takes, his queen will be open to

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,640
 target many things in my half of the board, which is a bit dangerous for the video. So I guess,

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,720
 A3, this move is to prevent knight C3 bishop B4 bishop takes C3 ending the video in the future.

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,160
 Knight D7. Bishop G5, I mean there's F6 but I can't resist that feeling of trapping a woman

12
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:31,920
 in her own house. F6. EF6 GF6 bishop H4. Trust me, I will win his queen. Bishop H6. Knight E5.

13
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,320
 F takes E5. Aha, that blunders a woman. In no world do you take my pawn here instead of my bishop.

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:52,240
 No doubt. Queen H5 check. King D8. Okay, now the question is, do I take his bishop?

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,840
 I mean if I take his bishop, there is a big chance that he'll go E takes David, which ends the video.

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:09,040
 Nah, I'm not gonna take that risk. D takes E5. Call me coward all you want, I'm just trying to

17
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:16,560
 save my video, and who knows, maybe he'll decide to keep blundering his bishop. Ha, that is very

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,200
 convenient. Queen takes H6. I'm sorry David, but at least you'll get to meet Edward in heaven.

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,520
 Farewell David. Knight D2. And look at that, he can't even end my video, no matter how much he

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:40,960
 wants to do so. D3. Aha, taking with bishop is obviously dumb, therefore, I'll take with pawn.

21
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,360
 In no world do you take this pawn now.

22
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,400
 What the f-
