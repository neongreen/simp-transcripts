00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 100 rated chess, but the marriage counseling went wrong, opponent's queen and king must not move

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,760
 toward each other. Sounds very heartbreaking, but of course, who gives a shit. We get a 1 22 from

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:22,880
 Russia. E4. E5. Still theory. Logically speaking, I definitely don't want my opponent to develop

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,680
 his queen. Therefore, D4. I mean if he is busy dealing with capturing stuff, he won't have time

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,480
 to move his queen out. Or he can also copy my moves and make me busy with capturing stuff instead of

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,200
 him. I'll take this ball. And I've just realized, that I'm literally just provoking him to move his

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:56,480
 queen out. I'm so f***ing stupid. Ha. Nevermind. Queen takes D4. Knight C6. Ah ha, this has to be

8
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,320
 the first time I've ever seen a 100 rated guy trying to use tactics against me, and for those

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,600
 of you guys who cannot see it, this guy is actually baiting me to take his knight, which blunders a

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,800
 queen, but sadly, I'm not that stupid. Alright, now we know that this guy is actually a real deal,

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,360
 this game is definitely going to be fun. Well, at least it's going to be fun for me.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,840
 That blunders a bishop. Queen E7 check. Taking his queen will make this challenge 100% a success,

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,440
 which is very boring, therefore, bishop blocks. For entertainment purposes,

14
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:43,840
 even if he takes my queen right now, I still won't take his queen back. Bishop D7. Yes. I'll

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:54,560
 retreat my queen first. H5. Very aggressive. That blunders a horsey. B takes C6. Ah ha, now bishop

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,400
 C6 bishop C6 queen C6 is winning a full rook, but then he may decide to block the check with queen

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,640
 D7, and after I take his rook, there is queen D8 ending the video because the distance from D7 to

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:14,800
 E8 is square root of 2, which is longer than D8 to E8. So I guess, I'll just play it safe. Rook H6.

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,280
 I'll take this pawn, my plan is to get him to play rook G6 queen retreats rook takes G2,

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,360
 because if he has an active rook, he'll have less motivation to move his queen.

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:33,920
 Or he can just move his queen instead. Knight C3. I can already see, that this challenge is

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,120
 going very wrong very quickly. Queen takes B2. Taking this knight is best, but it makes me a

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,680
 fool for forcing my opponent ending my video, I also cannot attack his queen because queen A3 also

24
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,120
 ends the video. So I guess, I have to take a risk. Alright, the plan is very simple. He takes my

25
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,160
 rook, I move my king up, he makes a random move, I checkmate in 1. And in no world do you take my

26
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,160
 knight right now to end my video.

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,960
 What the f-

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:25,440
