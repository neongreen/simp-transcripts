1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 *claps*

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Men and women, welcome to the first episode of Fake the ELO, where I play against a Discord member, and then try to guess their exact ELO after the game.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 If I guess it correctly, it's my win, otherwise, it's your win.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 And of course, as you can already see, since this is the first video in the series, it's 0-0.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Enough talking, let's go.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 My first opponent is a guy called the Boncloud Kings Gambit Tumbleweed.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 And as you can see, there's nothing here, so I literally didn't know anything about his ratings.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 C3. The Sarah Gosar opening.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 The fact that he's playing this opening means that he is either very low-rated, who only moves the pawns randomly, or that he is a grandmaster, trying to trick me into thinking that he is low-rated.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 E5. Well I mean there is another chance that it was just a mouse slip from C4.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 H4. Very aggressive.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 D5. Queen A4 check. Again, very aggressive.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Bd7. Queen A5.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Ah ha, he's obviously tricking me to play knight C6 attacking his queen, which blunders my d-pawn.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 The fact that he is delivering such tactics is giving me some ideas about how masterful he is at chess.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Knight F6.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 B4. Ah ha, now he realized that his last move was too good and could expose his ratings,

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 decided to play a weird move to fool me.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Knight C6.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Queen A3.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 A5.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Queen B3.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Bishop D6.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 It's kinda weird that a grandmaster is deciding to move his queen 4 times out of 7 moves,

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 but I'm sure that he will just pull his queen back any moment now, and then totally destroy me on the board.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Ah ha. You see? Now the game truly begins.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 D4.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Man, seeing a grandmaster starting to destroy me really caught me nervous, which results in such a bad move.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Maybe not.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Oh wait, I'm still thinking that he is very high rated, and is only playing poorly to trick me that he is bad.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Knight takes B4. I'm delivering a tactic here, whether he is gonna fall for it or not, will contribute a lot to my final answer.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And he saw it.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Wow. I mean he could have just blundered his queen to fool me, but I guess he just can't let his woman die.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 The pawn die for the woman.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And the queen is back.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I'll take this pawn as well.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 King takes.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Alright, I guess that is all the information we can get from this guy, so let's just end this game real fast.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 E4.

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Queen E3.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Bishop A4.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Queen A3.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Maybe I will have to give another rule in the episode that players must not move a piece too many times to ruin my video.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 But anyway, that blunders a king.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Bishop F4 check.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 King back to E1.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Checkmating with knight looks cool, but you know, since the D1 square originally belonged to his queen, why not replace it with my queen.

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Checkmate.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Alright, here comes the main part.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Unlike some chess master, who only gives his assumption is some ranges, I will only try to guess the exact number.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 The fact that he could save his queen twice makes me think that he is at least 700, but since all the other moves were so bad, I really can't make a judgement call.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Ah ha! I know, let's do this.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Now since the game is done, can you tell me your exact ELO so I can compare with my prediction?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 8-0-4.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Ah ha! Perfect.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 My guess is he is an 804 rated player.

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Yeah, it's correct.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And by the way, what was your guess?

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Ha! You fool.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:41,000
