 New Year Chess, you give away 2 pawns, 0 rooks, 2 bishops and 2 knights, but if your opponent

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,880
 refuses, the video ends. Nice. I don't think I will have any problems playing with only a queen

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:26,080
 and 2 rooks. We get a 3-0-2 from France. E4. C5. So I guess we can start with the pawns. D4.

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:37,040
 C takes D4. Yes. Taking back the pawn will make it a trade, and not a giveaway anymore. Therefore,

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:47,040
 C3. D takes. Perfect. I think today's video is gonna go really well guys. But anyway, now I'm

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,960
 being down 2 pawns, but if I take his pawn back, it will turn out that I only gave away 1 pawn

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:04,800
 instead of 2. Therefore, Bc4. Of course you will continue to take. Right? No. It doesn't count,

8
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,560
 because I still haven't taken that pawn back yet, so it's still a full giveaway of 2 pawns.

9
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:20,640
 Bf7 check. K takes is forced. Nf3. It's getting kinda annoying that I can't sacrifice my other

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:31,600
 bishop, due to his pawn can just go all the way down. Qb6. Very aggressive. Qc2. Just please take

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:42,960
 this pawn and let me develop my bishop. G6. Fine. Ng5 check. Perfect. And you know what,

12
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,480
 since he keeps refusing to take, I think I have an idea. Nd2. I'm planning that after he takes

13
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,680
 my knight, I'll go Kf1, D takes c8 changing gender, and I'll take his new woman, which still

14
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,040
 keeps the 2 pawns count, which means I'll be fulfilling all of the mission's goals.

15
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,800
 Unless he refuses to take my knight and end my video.

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,120
 Well, happy new year.
