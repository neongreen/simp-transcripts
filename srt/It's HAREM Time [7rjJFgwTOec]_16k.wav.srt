00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 100 rated chess, but each side has 8 queens, or you draw the spider queen.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,880
 Well, I heard about the spider man, but never heard about his wife.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,240
 We get a 1 74 from Spain.

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,600
 E4. Since I need to have 8 queens, pushing pawns early doesn't seem to be a great idea.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,240
 Therefore, knights E6.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,840
 D3. Not very aggressive.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,040
 B6. Knight C3. And that was a pre-move.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,720
 Very confident. Bishop B7. Nothing crazy so far.

9
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,960
 Bishop G5. Aha, now the crazy stuff is kicking in.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,360
 F6. Somehow I feel like he's gonna play queen H5 check and blunder his bishop.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,920
 Well, he didn't play queen H5, but still blunders his bishop.

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:06,480
 E5. Aha, very tricky. This guy is trying to trick me to go knight takes E5,

13
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,720
 which blunders my bishop back. Therefore, rook B8.

14
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,840
 D4. That blunders a pawn, but let's be careful.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,440
 Taking on E5 will make my knight abate for him to take, which blunders his queen,

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,280
 but since the mission requires my opponent to have 8 queens,

17
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,680
 losing a pawn and a queen will make his maximum amount of queens is 7,

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,440
 which fails the mission, which means even if he blunders his queen,

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,000
 I still cannot take it, so I'll be losing a knight, instead of winning a queen.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,480
 Therefore, knight takes D4. Okay, now I have to be careful,

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,240
 because I cannot take any pawns, and I cannot take his queen.

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,960
 Bishop C4. That blunders a woman. But again, I cannot take it, due to the rules.

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,320
 E6. Actually, when you think about it, how am I supposed to win this mission anyway?

24
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,720
 Ha! I guess I don't have to think about how to win the mission anymore.

25
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,240
 King takes F7 is forced.

26
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,840
 Alright then, it's drawing time, but when I google search for spider queen,

27
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,720
 there are too many results, so I guess I will just pick one myself.

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:43,680
 Yeah, I think it's fine.

29
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:59,040
