00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but you're a Star Wars fan, you must make the following moves.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,760
 C3, Rook 2 D2, Bishop B8. I have never watched Star Wars or read any of their products,

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:22,160
 but I'll pretend I'm a fan in this video. We get A1 1 8 from India. C3 is forced. Fun fact,

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,520
 I actually had to quit a lot of games to finally get to play with the white pieces just for the C3

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:36,960
 move. C5. Rook 2 D2 is the most complicated move to execute, so I guess we'll go with Bishop B8

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:47,200
 first. D4. C takes D4. Bishop F4. Man. The fact that he pushed his C pawn first to open up this

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:56,400
 diagonal makes this guy look like an amazing unpaid actor. Queen A5. Very aggressive. Bishop B8.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:05,120
 Rook takes B8. Alright, in order to perform Rook 2 D2, we're gonna need 1 rook on rank 2,

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,560
 1 rook on the D-file, and then the rook on rank 2 will move to D2. Therefore,

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,720
 H4. This rook is going to the D-file, by the fastest way possible.

11
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:28,400
 Queen H5. Rook H3. Knight F6. Rook D3. Apparently this guy is doing some sort of never-pushing

12
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:37,760
 center pawns challenge. Knight E4. A4. 1 rook on the D-file, the other goes to rank 2.

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:51,440
 Knight takes F2. Very aggressive. That blunders a horsey. G5. Rook A2. 2 steps done. Now we open

14
00:01:51,440 --> 00:02:00,640
 the road. Queen H4 check. G3. In no world do you blunder your queen now to force me capture and

15
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:18,480
 then you resign? Of course. B4. The path is made, nothing can go wrong now. Nothing can go wrong now.

16
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:29,440
 There we go. Mission accomplished, Rook 2 D2. And then somehow chess.com decided to write it as Rook

17
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:38,240
 A D2 instead. Well, if this is the case, then I don't know how to do this challenge anymore.

18
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,560
 Apparently chess.com prefers to write down the file instead of the rank,

19
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:49,440
 so if my logic is correct, there is literally no way to make a rook 2 D2. Therefore, mission

20
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,960
 Impossible.

21
00:02:50,960 --> 00:03:05,800
