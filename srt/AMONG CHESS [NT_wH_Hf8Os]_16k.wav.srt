00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 100 rated chess, but your own pieces can attack your king. If you're checked, the video's wrecked.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,280
 I mean I normally don't take on easy challenges, but since this guy got 9 reactions,

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,520
 maybe there's something I'm missing. E4. Well even though my king is being checked by my queen

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,920
 right now, I think we can all agree that there was nothing I can do about this, therefore, E5.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:35,600
 Let's just say, that the challenge starts from move 3. Knight F3. Ok. Here we go. Queen F6.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:44,720
 Alright, now the challenge truly begins. D3. Bishop C5. Alright, how about knight D2?

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:53,040
 Of course not. Queen B6. Man I feel like an absolute 100 rated player right now for aiming

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:01,040
 for his F pawn. Bishop back to E3. Of course I'll take it. F takes. I'll take this pawn.

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,200
 I think taking the other pawn could have been a little bit better because my queen can prevent

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,560
 castling for a while, but taking this way opens up the possibility of winning his rook as well.

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,200
 I solemnly swear, that he's not a paid actor or unpaid actor, well I mean he could be an actor

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,200
 in real life, but the point is that he's not my actor, and I think you get the idea. Queen takes

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,400
 A1. Man maybe this challenge is actually even easier than what I expected. Knight D2. I cannot

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,200
 move this knight because that will make my rook check my king, therefore, I'll use the other

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,720
 knight. Same thing like the other side, now I also cannot move this bishop because of the other rook.

16
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,240
 G3. Not very aggressive. I mean playing chess with only a queen and a horsey is not really a good

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,800
 idea, so I guess, A5. I'll develop my rook this way, and then develop the light bishop. Bishop G2.

18
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,560
 Rook K6. Man Stockfish must be so mad at me for keeping ignoring this pawn for like a hundred

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:11,680
 moves. Castle. Alright, I'll take that pawn. Knight C3. That blunders another pawn, well at least

20
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,760
 both edwards are still alive. Knight B5. Aha, he's obviously going for knight takes C7 check,

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,720
 which forks my rook and ends my video at the same time. Therefore, knight B4. Well I mean it's pretty

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:35,600
 hard to see, but he does see that my queen is now controlling the C7 square. Right? Thank god,

23
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:42,160
 that threatened queen takes F7 king D8 is forced. Queen F8 checkmate in 2 and also ends my video,

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:48,960
 and since knight F6 makes me a fool for ending my own video. Rook F6. This move not only defends

25
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,080
 the checkmate, counter-attack on the queen, but also removes the rook from being forked,

26
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,560
 which even further gives him absolutely no reason to go knight takes C7.

27
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,320
 I'm not gonna lie, some parts of me actually saw that was coming.

28
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:21,120
 (Outro)
