 It's January 1st, 2023, and what better way to start a year, than by calling my viewers,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,560
 cheaters. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the first ever episode of my viewers cheat.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,520
 The rules are very simple, we play a custom position, but my opponent gets to play with

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:24,080
 stockfish, with some special restrictions, that I'll explain during the video. Too much talking,

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,720
 Knight df6. As you can see, I'm opening stockfish right now for my opponent to use, but I actually

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:38,000
 cannot see it because I'm censoring it on my computer. Trust. Rook h6. I think my pieces

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,480
 are placed correctly, now let's just move the king. Rook h4 king b6 bishop e6 king c7.

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,920
 The plan is very simple, I want to go king b8 threatening his pawn, which provokes rook h8

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,040
 check protecting the pawn, and then I can go knight e8 countercheck and also skew as the rook.

10
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,720
 He saw it. Alright, as I said before, my opponent can only use stockfish with some special

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,320
 restrictions. At the beginning of the game, I asked him to choose a number from 1 to 5,

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,760
 he picked 4, so now after 4 moves, I'll disable stockfish. No worries, I'll enable it back after

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:25,520
 4 moves more. King d6. Bishop f5. That was his first ever real move in this entire game. King e5,

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:35,200
 rook h3 knight d5 bishop g4 aha! That blunders a fork. King f7. Alright, 4 moves surpassed,

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:43,520
 I'll enable stockfish again. Knight takes h3. Bishop takes d1. That makes this pawn too dangerous,

16
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:55,600
 I'll take it. Bishop g4. Knight g5 check. King e8. Knight d e4. Bishop e2. 4 moves again,

17
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,760
 stockfish disabled, he's trying to bait me to take his bishop and let his f-pawn change his gender,

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:11,040
 so of course, I'll eliminate it first. Bishop takes f1. Knight e6. Bishop g2. Unfortunately,

19
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,760
 that trick doesn't work this time, now since he has blundered everything he's got,

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,400
 we shuffled our pieces for a few moves, and he promoted to a knight. You know what? I'm just

21
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,720
 gonna let that horsey live. And then after a few more moves, I get 2 queens, and he resigned.

22
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:41,280
 Ha! Even with stockfish, my viewers still cannot beat me.

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,400
