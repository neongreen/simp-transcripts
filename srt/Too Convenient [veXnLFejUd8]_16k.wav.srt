 100 rated chess, but your pieces are afraid of landmines, they can only move to squares that

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,520
 have been walked on by a pawn or an enemy piece. This obviously sounds way too easy,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,640
 so let's just say, that we only count my pawns. Yeah, now that sounds a bit more challenging.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:28,560
 We get a 130 from France. E4, E6 expected. Or not. D4, the plan is obviously to expand as fast

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,360
 as possible so that my pieces can have a lot of squares to move, and even though this may strike

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,680
 back at me for skipping E3 and D3, I am confident to say that I don't need those useless squares.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:48,080
 Knight C6. D5, okay now my queen can go to D4, and if he can just play knight D4 right now and

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,800
 blunder a horsey, that will be the most convenient thing ever existed on this channel.

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,800
 I solemnly swear, that I don't even know this guy, not to mention about hiring him as an actor.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,960
 I'll take the horsey. Well, I mean at least he won't just blunder his bishop now.

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,960
 C5. En passant. Ha, of course I'll play an en passant against a French opponent.

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:23,600
 B takes C6. C4, okay now knight C3 is not possible, but we can always develop it this way instead.

13
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,840
 Bishop D7. F4, I mean since this bishop is stuck behind the pawns, how about pushing this pawn

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:44,160
 then. Sadly he's not a paid actor. Queen D1. D5. Very aggressive. That blunders a pawn. E6,

15
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,960
 trading pawns is not a good idea because I need them to open up the way for the other pieces to

16
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,360
 play the game. Therefore, D6. C4. That blunders another pawn, and since I've had a pawn on C4

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,000
 before. Bishop takes C4 is allowed. Winning pawn is definitely amazing, but quite frankly,

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,640
 I don't even like it if he blunders his bishop into my pawn. Very convenient, but not very

19
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:19,280
 convenient. Queen takes D6. Queen B8. Ah ha, trading queens is obviously the best move,

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,800
 but since I haven't moved any pawns to that square yet, I guess I'll retreat. E5. That blunders

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,160
 another pawn, don't know if he has some sort of hatred against those peasants. Knight E7. Bishop

22
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,640
 F4. Alright, I guess the plan is just to take as many pieces as possible and force him to resign,

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,360
 because I cannot see any ways to move my pieces closer to his king. And just as I want to take

24
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,520
 materials, he blunders a bishop. Knight takes. Queen E4. Knight D6 allowing E D6 winning a

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,640
 horsey with a discovered check is probably the most convenient move right now, but such amazing

26
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:12,720
 thing can never happen in real life. He takes D6. King F8. Ah ha, that blunders a king to queen E7

27
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,440
 check king G8 is forced queen F7 checkmate in 2, but since I haven't landed any pawns on E7 yet,

28
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,480
 I guess I'll have to go for? D7. Man, it's getting difficult to think of a good plan to attack his

29
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,400
 king. Nevermind. Mission accomplished.
