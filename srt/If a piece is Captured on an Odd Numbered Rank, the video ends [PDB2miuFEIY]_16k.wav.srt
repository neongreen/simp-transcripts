1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 If a piece or a pawn is captured on an uneven numbered rank, the video ends.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 This shouldn't be too hard. Let's find an opponent.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 [Music]

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 We get a 2 22 from the US.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Black pieces.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Man, I think it would be easier if I got the white pieces.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 But anyway, this is life.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 For those of you who are wondering how to count the rank numbers, don't worry.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 They are all written right, here.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 If something dies on the odd numbered ranks, the video ends.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 D4.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Knight F6.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Just want to put my horsey on an even rank.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Queen D3.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Very aggressive.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 D6.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 F3.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 G6.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 You know, I'm just trying to play on the even ranks here.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 E4.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Again, very, aggressive.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Bishop G7.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 C3.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 This guy is very aggressive and very solid at the same time.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 This guy is such a legend.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I'll castle.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Bishop F4.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Knight.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 C6.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I mean the D7 square is on an uneven rank, right?

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Knight D2.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Okay now how do I make progress?

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 I mean normally people would play E5, D takes E5, knight takes E5, bishop takes E5, D takes E5, and it's a winning position for black.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 But of course, a capture on E5, ends the video.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 So I guess, A5.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Let's just B.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 A pawn pushing simpleton.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Long castle.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Very risky.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 B6.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Queen B5.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Man! This guy is really aggressive.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Bishop D7.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Queen C4.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Queen B8.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Knight E2.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 B5.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 There is no way this is a move.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Why is he thinking for so long?

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Queen back to D3.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 B4.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Please take! It's on an even rank.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Yes!

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Knight takes.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Even rank baby!

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Queen C4.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 That blunders a queen.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Now I have, bishop E6, D5, knight F takes D5, E takes E5,

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 E takes D5, bishop takes D5, trapping the queen.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Of course things may proceed differently, but I believe that losing only a queen is the best continuation for him.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 But no! Because you know, that sequence ends the video.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Therefore, bishop to B5.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Queen B3.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Bishop D3.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I'm just slowly getting in there.

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Queen A4.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Let's see.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I think I need more pieces into the attack.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Knight back to D7.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Oh no my video!

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 No!

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Because he should be able to see, that if he goes queen takes D7,

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 knight takes A2, is a checkmate in one.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 *click*

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 I can already see, that some people are going to say,

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 "You did that on purpose."

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 But anyway,

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 what the f-

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 *outro music*
