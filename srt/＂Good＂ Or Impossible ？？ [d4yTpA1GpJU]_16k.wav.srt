 100 rated chess, but Andy and Edward are in love, connect these pawns before you win,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,960
 if one of them dies, the video ends. And then the guy below that said. Okay, this is good.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,960
 I absolutely don't know where the good part is because this is obviously very impossible.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,320
 But of course, let's try it out anyway, we get a 237 from Ireland.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,680
 E4. For those of you guys who don't know, Edward is actually the E pawn, and Andy is actually the

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,760
 A pawn, which is to say, that I need to connect these two pawns together. And as you can see,

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:45,680
 they are not very close to each other. E6. The idea is D5, E takes D5, E takes D5,

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:54,480
 and then Edward will be a little bit closer to Andy. H4. Very aggressive. D5, of course takes

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:03,840
 stakes. Right? Maybe not. Bc5. It's fine, I also need to win this game after the pawns are connected,

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:12,160
 so there's nothing wrong to prepare everything beforehand. D4. Oh, wait. I think I have a great

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:21,840
 idea. Ne7. The plan is very simple. D takes C5, B6, C takes B6, A takes B6, and then Andy is a

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,440
 little bit closer to Edward. Yes, I mean people usually don't like to capture away from the center,

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,520
 but they really cannot say no to a free piece. B6. I mean of course he'll take right,

14
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,360
 there's literally nothing else to think about here. Well I mean he can also give an empty check

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,920
 first, C6. This move also removes a defender of my B pawn, which further provokes him to capture.

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:57,040
 Ba4. Nd7. Ha, I'm attacking your pawn, you better capture my pawn when you're still having a chance

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:05,520
 to do so. Perfect. And E to B6, and after 8 moves into the game, I finally made some progress.

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:15,280
 Bb3. Nc5. Aha, now I'm attacking your E pawn too, so once again, you better take something while

19
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:23,520
 you still can. Very convenient. Edward to D5. Man I'm so proud of myself to be able to get this far

20
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,200
 into the mission, now I just need something to capture my knight, and then the mission is completed.

21
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,260
 What the f-
