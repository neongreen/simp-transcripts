 100 rated chess, but your king is riding your opponent's horses. If they go up,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:14,000
 your king will go up. If they go down, your king will go down. This may go very wrong very quickly.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 We get a 6d9, I mean 690 from the US. Ha, this guy is pretty high rated,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,840
 so hopefully he won't make weird moves that can end my video quickly.

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,920
 E4, I'm opening up some space to move my king up, but of course,

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,080
 the best case scenario, is still not moving the king up at all.

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:44,960
 C5. Sicilian. Knight F3. That is actually really bad though, because I've seen a lot

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,680
 of low rated players who play knight C6 here, which is not good for my king.

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,360
 Wow, this has to be the first time I've ever seen a low rated player plays the correct second move

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,720
 of Sicilian theories. D4, and since he's been playing all the correct moves, he'll definitely

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:15,760
 take this pawn, right? Knight C6. Fine. King E2. Man, now there's knight takes D4 check,

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:22,400
 king E3, knight takes F3, and I'll have to continue advancing my king instead of recapturing.

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:31,840
 This video is going very wrong very quickly. Ha, not even close. Pushing the pawn to attack

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:42,240
 his knight is obviously a bad idea. Therefore, C3. E5, aha, that pawn now took away the E5 square

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,760
 from his knight. Therefore, D5. Now after he pull his knight back, I can finally pull my king back.

16
00:01:49,760 --> 00:02:00,960
 Or he can just play knight A5 and absolutely ruin my plan. Thank you. King E1. Ha, easiest mission

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,960
 of my entire channel. Now knight C8 ends the video, because my king doesn't have any squares

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:20,320
 to go down. But of course, no one plays like that anyway. Right? What the f-

00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:34,800
