2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 You're a stupid child, chasing your dreams and getting hurt

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 You're a bad liar, but you showed me a smile that couldn't be laughed at

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 You don't even say "I love you" well, you're really clumsy with your words

5
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 But, but why did you say "goodbye"?

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 You're no good, no good, no good

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I love you, I love you too much

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 No matter how strong the alcohol is

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Memories that don't waver, like an idiot

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:48,000

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 You're like an idiot, really an idiot

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 You only believe

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 You pretend to be a strong woman

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 You bathe in the night wind of sadness

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Three years have passed since I became alone

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Even the cityscape has changed

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,060
 you
