 100 rated chess, but you have a secret objective, after your 5th move, you may reveal your mission

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,480
 objective below. Okay before the video begins, I just want to say that I accidentally misremember

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,080
 the challenge to, before the 5th move, so let's just change the challenge so that it fits how the

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:28,800
 video actually went. Let's go. We get a 120 American. E4. E5. Still theory. Queen H5. The

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,400
 plan is very simple. If I have to start the challenge from move 5, I'll end the game at move

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:42,800
 4, or you may say, the 4 move checkmate. Queen E7. That is actually a very good move for beginners,

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,440
 because even though it blocks the bishop, the queen alone can defend both the center E pawn

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,840
 and the weak F pawn from the checkmate. Bishop C4. I mean who knows, maybe he'll put his queen

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:04,080
 down and make this video extremely convenient. Of course that doesn't happen. Queen F3. F5. Okay.

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,760
 Now we open the challenge. All of your pieces, except horses and pawns, are immobile defenses,

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,800
 they cannot move except to capture. Ah ha, so now if I take this pawn, he can push E4 to attack my

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,720
 queen and then I'll lose my woman because I cannot move her to safety. Therefore, knight C3.

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,520
 Queen C5. Taking this knight seems to be a great option as I cannot pull my bishop back,

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,920
 but since I'm not a coward. D3. As I can not move anything else beside horses and pawns,

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:46,480
 this active bishop should be contributing to our victory. Knight C6. Ah ha, now knight D4 is just

16
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,040
 straight up winning my queen because I cannot move her due to the rules, so I guess, E takes F5.

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:02,160
 This strategy is called, the distraction. And he is distracted. Queen F5 D5 queen H5 forcing a king

18
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,480
 move is obviously the best continuation, but since I cannot move my queen after D5 discovered attack,

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:21,200
 I guess it's knight H3 instead. D6. Knight G5. No worries, I have a plan. H6. Okay. Here we go.

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,760
 Knight E6. The idea is to trade off my opponent light square bishop, so that my bishop can be

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,440
 placed on a very strong square, and my queen can also get into his territory by taking this pawn.

22
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:44,000
 Exactly as planned. Bishop dates. E4. Very aggressive. Queen takes F5 is kinda forced,

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,520
 if he takes my queen, it's a queen trade, if he doesn't take my queen, I have my chance at a

24
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:59,120
 checkmate. King E7. Ah ha, that blunders a king to queen F7 king D8 is forced queen D7 checkmate

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:07,760
 in 2, but since queen F7 is against the rules, I guess it's knight D5 instead. King D8. Queen takes

26
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,960
 F8. Checkmate. Mission, accomplished.

27
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:27,120
