00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
 100 rated chess, but two queens, or more, cannot be on the same diagonal, file, and row.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,560
 Of course, the women must not die. I normally don't take on impossible challenges,

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,040
 but since it's about the women, I really cannot refuse. We get a 100 rated from Palestine.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,720
 I mean the queens are obviously on the same file right now, which is against the rules,

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,080
 but since there is nothing I can do about it, let's just say, that the starting position,

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:44,800
 doesn't count. E4. The plan is simple. Move the queen, and that's all. E5. Alright, queen f3 is

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,960
 very natural, but there is also a big chance that he will play queen f6 as well to end the video,

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,440
 queen e2 is safer, but he can also play queen e7, not to mention that I will be blocking my light

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,080
 square bishop. Therefore, queen h5 is kinda forced. I mean there are still queen g5 and

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:14,160
 queen h4 ending the video, but who plays like that anyway. Right? Of course, that blunders a rook to

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,800
 queen takes e5 forking his king and rook, but if I play that, he can also play queen e7 to block

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:29,520
 the check, which also ends the video. So I guess, queen h3. At least I think queen g3 will definitely

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:38,880
 keep the video safe for a while. D6. Queen g3. Perfect, the g3 square is such an amazing position

14
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:50,480
 for my queen, and in no world do you play queen g5 or queen h4 now. Absolutely. Bishop c4. Knight h6.

15
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,200
 D3. Somehow it seems like he is trying to take over the sides of the board instead of the center.

16
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:05,680
 A4. Bishop g5. I mean I wasn't allowed to capture his queen, but there was no rule saying that I

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,040
 cannot attack her. Well, there is also no rule saying that he cannot blunder his queen either.

18
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,400
 Queen f3. Oh no my bishop, and even though there is a small chance that he may mouse slip his queen

19
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:31,040
 on f6 instead, but such absurd thing won't just happen at this exact time. Right? Yeah, that's

20
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,160
 right. Queen takes f7. Checkmate. Mission accomplished, but since the video is still

21
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,800
 pretty short, I'll answer some of your comments instead. For some reason, for the first half of

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,680
 the video, I thought the backrow pawns could move backwards to check the white king. Ha! Only half

23
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,600
 the video, what a noob. I thought that for the entire game that I was playing with that guy,

24
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,920
 and I'm also sure that that guy also thinks of the same thing. I would like an ordinary game of

25
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,240
 five minutes with him to prove he is not better than all of his viewers. Ha! In your dream,

26
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:23,840
 that will never happen.

27
