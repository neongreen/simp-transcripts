1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
 100 rated chess, but you are a chad.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,320
 Every time you can make a move that violates a chess principle, you have to play it.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,320
 This is going to be fun.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,600
 Ah ha.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:19,360
 First off, principle number 63, try not to look at your opponent's rating until after the game.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:19,920
 Guess what?

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,800
 We get a 127 from the US.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,240
 And quite frankly, I've been breaking this principle in literally almost every single

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,160
 video on this channel.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,200
 H4.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,880
 Principle number 02, control the center.

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,200
 So of course I control the rim instead.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
 Knight F6.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,440
 Rook H3.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,160
 I mean it would be boring if I keep breaking the same principle over and over again,

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,200
 so this move is to prepare for the next principle to come.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,440
 E5.

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,520
 Very aggressive.

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,920
 Principle number 28, develop your rooks to the open files, and principle number 29, put

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
 rooks behind passed pawns.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,560
 Guess what?

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,920
 Rook D3.

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,680
 Develop the rook to a closed file, and of course, in front of the pawns, regardless

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,440
 that they are passed pawns or not.

25
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,600
 D6.

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,800
 Ah ha.

27
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,280
 Here comes my favorite principle.

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,280
 Principle number 21, do not make careless pawn moves, they cannot move back.

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,640
 So of course.

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,760
 E4.

31
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,920
 I'm sorry Edward, but you need to die for the video's sake.

32
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,320
 Edward is dead.

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,760
 But anyway.

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,160
 Principle number 26, don't bring your queen out early.

35
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,200
 Therefore, queen F3.

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,880
 My position is totally fine.

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,360
 Knight takes F2.

38
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,960
 Ah ha.

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,280
 Now queen takes is obviously the best move, but principle number 27, castle soon to protect

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,200
 your king and develop your rook.

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,760
 So how about, we don't castle at all.

42
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,760
 Let's go my useless king.

43
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,840
 C6.

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,240
 Not very aggressive.

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,160
 Principle number 05, a knight on the rim is dim.

46
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,440
 So of course.

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,320
 A knight is dim.

48
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,720
 Queen B6 check.

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,400
 Ah ha.

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,480
 King back is obviously the best option.

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,840
 But principle number 31, don't let your king get caught in the center.

52
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
 Which is to say.

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,960
 King to the center.

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,560
 And to be honest, I think my king is absolutely safe.

55
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
 H5.

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
 Very aggressive.

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,600
 Okay now most of the remaining principles only regard about how a person should learn

58
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,160
 to play chess and things resemble to that.

59
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,480
 So I guess, knight G5.

60
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,120
 Let's just play the game normally until there comes a chance for a new principle to be broken.

61
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,440
 Rook H6.

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,720
 Queen F7 king D8 queen F8 king D7.

63
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,000
 Ah ha.

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Here we go.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,280
 The last principle of all, principle number 64.

66
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,200
 Always play for a win.

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,320
 Therefore, queen F7 check.

68
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,760
 The plan is king D8 queen F8 king D7 queen F7 king D8 queen F8.

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,600
 I make a draw instead of a win.

70
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,960
 [Blooper]

71
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,080
 The mission is failed, but before the video ends, I just want to say that in this article

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,800
 that I used for this video, the author actually missed one more principle.

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,800
 Principle number 65, never talk about chess principles on a chess website, because even

74
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,840
 though this guy spent like 20 hours to write this massive article to help new players get

75
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,880
 into the game.

76
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,480
 If we look just a bit closer.

77
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,760
 Account.

78
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,040
 Closed.
