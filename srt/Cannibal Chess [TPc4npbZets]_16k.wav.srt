00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 100 rated chess. But you, and your opponent, can only kill a piece, with that exact same piece.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,600
 Pawns as well. And by the way. Is it same exact, or exact same?

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:23,360
 Man. English is weird. But anyway, we get a 2 0 7 from Chili. Pawns should be the most useful

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:33,520
 guys in this challenge. Therefore, E4. Let's just push all of them forward. D5. Ah ha. If I take

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,600
 that pawn, Queen takes will end the video, because a Queen can only capture another Queen, and not a

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:50,480
 pawn. Therefore, E5. E6. D4. Ha. Now it's an advanced French instead. And he knows the theory.

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:04,080
 Wow. C3. Alright. I'm kinda scared now. C takes D4. C takes D4. Oh. Wait. I made a mistake.

8
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,480
 Now if he plays Bishop B4 check, I cannot block with my knight, because he can take it and end

9
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:15,840
 the video, I also cannot block with my bishop, because if he takes my bishop, I also cannot

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,360
 take back with another piece, since that means I will be ending my own video, which means if Bishop

11
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:32,240
 B4 happens, King E2 will be kinda forced. Thank you. A3. Well I mean he can still play Bishop B4

12
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,120
 because the rule doesn't allow me to take his bishop. But of course he'll not blunder a piece

13
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:47,600
 like that. Right? There we go. He obviously preparing G4 if I play knight F3 now. Therefore,

14
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:56,480
 H3. Knight H6. It seems like he really wants to stop me from playing knight F3. But sadly,

15
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:03,760
 that doesn't work. Knight F3. He should be able to see, that G4 is blundering a pawn to Bishop takes

16
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:13,200
 H6 Bishop takes H6 H takes G4, or Bishop takes H6 G takes F3 Bishop takes F8 F takes G2 Bishop

17
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:23,840
 takes G2 King takes F8 and his king won't be able to castle. Right? Maybe not. Of course I cannot

18
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,360
 take his knight due to the rules, I also cannot take his pawn because knight takes will also end

19
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,880
 the video. But I also don't want to move my knight away because that makes me look like a coward.

20
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:42,480
 Therefore, Bishop G5. Let's just see what happens first, and I think there is actually a small

21
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,040
 chance that he will play queen A5 Bishop D2 queen D8 Bishop G5 and then we repeat moves for a

22
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,960
 precious draw. Nevermind. Now he has a double attack on my pieces, and both of those moves

23
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,400
 actually end the video as well. Therefore, he takes F6 is kinda forced. Alright, it's still

24
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,160
 fine though. He should be able to see, that I'm threatening F7 check, with a discovered attack on

25
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:19,520
 his queen, so in no world does he end my video now. Right? Ha! So he didn't see the threat,

26
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:28,240
 and also didn't end the video. H takes G4. Another problem solved. Now just play knight F7 to defend

27
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:36,640
 your queen and everything is good. Dude. Just as I've just solved a problem, another one comes up.

28
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,280
 D takes E5 is kinda forced. Dude. Stop blundering your queen,

29
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,320
 and just play that move so that we both can be happy.

30
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:56,160
 Well I kinda saw that was coming, so there's no what the f*** today.

31
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:10,640
