00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 I'm better than my viewers. Queen assassin. I don't know what's going on with these chuny

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,240
 titles right here. But well, I'll respect your hobby. The challenger this time is a guy called

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,600
 Beef, and so far, he is the highest rated viewer in this series. My bishop is eyeing down his queen,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,520
 but D4 is obviously blundering queen E6 king C5 knight A6 king B5 queen C6 king A5 B6 checkmate

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:36,480
 in four with a pawn, therefore, D3. Queen H4. Very aggressive. That queen is obviously trying

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,960
 to prevent my king from going back, but it can be solved. With E4, I mean he can win a pawn,

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,120
 but I'm willing to sacrifice a pawn to move my king back. Knight C6. Let's move back. Man I feel

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:01:01,840
 like just one mistake and I'm dead. B5. Of course I'm not gonna take that pawn. King C3. Aha, now

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,240
 he finally takes that pawn. Queen E2. Normally you don't want to trade queens when you're down

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:17,520
 in materials, but this game is not very normal as far as I can see. B4 check. King D2. Man this guy

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,680
 is 1500 and he's letting my king get away really easy, I'll be honest that I was expecting a little

12
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,760
 bit more challenging plays from him. Queen trade. Bishop takes, E5 A3 B takes knight takes F5.

13
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:38,880
 That blunders a pawn. Man, at this point, people are so gonna call this guy a paid actor.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,760
 Knight F6. Knight F3. Bishop C5. I was hoping that he would take my knight so only I have the

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:54,720
 bishop there, but since he didn't do it, I'll have to make good use of this knight. Knight C4. I

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,560
 think that move was pretty bad, but the situation is very tactical that it's not very easy for him

17
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:11,840
 to find a good move. D6. C3. Bishop takes F5. B4. Now I'm gonna trade his bishop down, unless he

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:21,040
 has enough testosterone to play bishop F2. Or that. Wow. This guy just really doesn't want to give up

19
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:30,000
 his bishop. I'll take that knight. Bishop takes, king C2. Okay, the situation is 3 pawns for a

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,960
 horsey, but I think my position is a little bit better than his. Long castle. That blunders a

21
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,000
 pawn. Bishop C5 rook A5 rook H E8. In this position, there is a brilliant move for white,

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,760
 so please feel free to pause the video to find it, while I don't give you any seconds to do so,

23
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,000
 and the move is. Knight takes E5. I mean the idea is pretty obvious that this pawn is being

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,840
 overloaded, so I actually don't know why Stockfish is so obsessed about it. Bishop B4 rook A8 check

25
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,680
 king B7 bishop F3 check D5 rook takes D8 rook takes D8 bishop E3 king A6 knight C6. And in this

26
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:25,520
 position, my opponent resigned. Therefore, I'm better than my viewers.

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,820
