00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
 100 rated chess, but you can't take the unprotected pieces. And pawns. Very challenging.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:22,480
 We get a 1 29 from the US. E4. E5. Still theory. Knight f3. D5. Very aggressive. There are 2 pawns

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,400
 that I can take, but since this pawn is not protected by anything, I actually can only take

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:40,000
 this pawn. Bishop d6. Bishop c4. Bishop c5. That blunders a pawn, but since it's not being

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,800
 protected by anything, I cannot take it, due to the rules. Castle. Queen d6. Again, very aggressive.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,920
 D4. Since he's playing really aggressive against me, I need to be polite and play aggressive back

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:06,080
 at him. Bishop d6. That blunders both bishops at the same time, and since they both are protected,

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:14,960
 taking either one is fine. Bishop takes d5. That blunders a queen. Wow, this mission is going way

9
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:22,880
 smoother than I expected. Bishop takes c4. I really want to take this pawn, but of course,

10
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,320
 that is against the rules. Rook e1. It's actually really weird that this guy hasn't made any crazy

11
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,320
 moves that take advantage of the mission yet. I shouldn't have said that. That blunders a bishop,

12
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,360
 but since it's not being protected, I cannot take it. Knight c3. Of course I need to move

13
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:53,360
 my knight away before he decides to take it for free. C takes d6. That blunders this bishop again.

14
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:03,920
 But anyway. Knight b5. Bishop c4. Ha! You know, I was planning to go knight c7 check to win his

15
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,880
 rook, but then I realized that his rook is also unprotected. And even worse, now he's trying to

16
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:19,440
 mock me by blundering his bishop in a very similar way. Fine. Knight back to c3. I feel like a real

17
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:30,400
 100 rated player now. Knight c6. Bishop d3. Knight d4. That blunders a horsey, but if I take his

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,840
 knight with my bishop, it will make his e-pawn pinned to his king, which means his knight wasn't

19
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,960
 actually protected, which makes me a fool for ending my own video. Therefore, I'll take with

20
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,360
 knight. I mean I can't just leave his knight there anyway, because if he takes my knight next turn,

21
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:57,360
 I wouldn't be able to take back due to the rules. E takes d4. Taking the pawn is obviously the best

22
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:07,440
 move, but of course, it's the rules ruining the fun again. Bishop f4 check. King d7. Very aggressive.

23
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:22,240
 Knight e2. Oh, wait. Yeah, I should have seen that coming. Queen d2. Ha! Coward. Queen b4.

24
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,320
 Bishop g4. Man, it seems like this guy really likes to move his bishop around.

25
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:38,560
 But anyway, that blunders a king. Queen takes d6 check. That pawn was protected by his king by the

26
00:03:38,560 --> 00:04:02,720
 way. King c8 is forced. Rook to e8. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.
