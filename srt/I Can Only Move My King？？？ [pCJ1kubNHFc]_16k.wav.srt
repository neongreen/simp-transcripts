 100 rated chess, but you can only move your king. And I did it successfully.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,160
 Smiley face. And it came with a picture. Draw by stalemate, 32 blunders,

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,680
 and one guy's name is chessimp69. With a weird avatar face.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,960
 But anyway, we get a 300 rated from Philippines.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,800
 Knight f3. Well, since the challenge only allows me to move my king, and it's stuck now.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,680
 So I guess. No wait. I was kidding. Let's just assume that we can move a pawn for our first move.

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,600
 E5. Since I'm not using any pieces or pawns this game, the best use for those trash is obviously,

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:58,160
 gambits. And he didn't even take it. King e7 is forced. What the f*** was that?

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,560
 Alright then. King e6. It would be nice if he blunders his knight now.

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:11,200
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor.

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:21,520
 King d5. King c3. Ha, he obviously wants to move his king forward to have more fun with my king.

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:30,880
 Therefore. King c5. No chance for you sir. King back to d3. Oh wait.

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:42,000
 Are you thinking what I'm thinking guys? King back to d5. King c3. Hell yeah. King c5.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,720
 Okay dude. Just one more time, and we both are happy. King d3. Ha. Easiest mission of my entire

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:01,280
 channel. King d5. Draw by repetition. Mission accomplished, but since the video is so short,

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,320
 I'll answer some of your comments instead. The king is not a piece. So if you open up google

17
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:14,240
 search and then type. The king is a piece. You can see here is a result of. The king is a piece

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,840
 in chess. But when you type the king is not a piece, you can receive a weird suggestion that

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:28,800
 is not even grammatically correct. How did you get a 435 opponent as a 100? You can blame chess.com

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:41,040
 for that man. They even paired me with a 1900 sometimes. Well. Beaver's claw by Maximum Arief.

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:55,280
 I have no idea.

22
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,860
 (upbeat music)
