00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 100 rated chess, but if you can blunder a pawn, you have to.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,920
 Very challenging. We get a 100 rated from Mexico.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,040
 Ha, 100 versus 100, this is going to be fun.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:22,080
 E4. It's actually pretty bad that I got the black pieces in such a difficult challenge.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,360
 But anyway. B5 is kinda forced. As the rule mentioned, I have to blunder a pawn, if I can do

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:42,160
 so. Bxb5. F5 is forced. This is going very wrong very quickly. Exf5. Qh5 check is obviously the

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:52,400
 biggest threat. Therefore, Nf6. C4. Aha! Finally, there is no more pawn that I can blunder.

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,840
 A6, somehow I have a feeling that he's gonna blunder his bishop right now. And it really

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:09,360
 happened. Bxd7. I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. Or at least, I didn't pay him.

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:18,160
 B4. Very aggressive. C5 is forced. It's fine though, because I think that I will have to

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:27,280
 lose all of my pawns before I can play the game normally. Bxc5. Aha! Once again, no blunders

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:42,400
 available. Bxf5. Qa4 check. Bb7. Bb2. Aha! That blunders a queen, but sadly, I have to blunder

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:54,320
 a pawn. Okay man, take my pawn. Oh please just take it. Aha! That is even better. Even though

14
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:01,280
 I can play g5 to blunder my g-pawn, I'm already having my e-pawn being free, and since he can

15
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,200
 only take one pawn at a time, I think we can all agree, that I don't need to blunder many pawns at

16
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:15,520
 once. Therefore, Bxa4. I mean there is some chances that he's just gonna resign right now.

17
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:30,880
 Maybe not. Bxc5. Nxe5. No pawns to blunder, so I guess, I'll take a pawn. Nxe2. Castle.

18
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:43,920
 H4. Very aggressive. G5 is forced. Wow! Now after Hxg5, H6 is forced, which blunders my knight,

19
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,000
 and my queen cannot even take back, because I need to leave my h-pawn free for his rook to take.

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:01,600
 This guy is totally destroying me right now. Nevermind. Nxe4. Hxg5. H6 is forced.

21
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:12,880
 Ba5. That blunders a bishop. Gxh6. That blunders a king, and even though there is a checkmate in 2,

22
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,160
 as a grandmaster once said, if you have a checkmate, look for a better one.

23
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:31,360
 Or something like that. Qxd2 check. Kf1 is forced. Rxf2 check. Kg1 is forced. Rxg5.

24
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,920
 Rxg2 check. Kxg2. Qxe2. Checkmate.

25
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,720
 Mission accomplished.

26
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:57,040
