1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 If a draw offer is accepted,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Simp shows his drawing skill.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 And I need to offer draw on every move.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Alright. So it's finally my day to be the most toxic player on chess.com.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Let's find an opponent.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 We get a 2-0-3 from the Dominican Republic.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Yes.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Pairing up with a much higher rated opponent helps my video a lot as well.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Since a draw will make him lose his rating points.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 D4.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Alright.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 As the challenge requires,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 draw offer.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 E5.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 I don't normally play the England gambit,

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 because it sucks.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 But for this video,

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 I believe that E5 should be the best way to execute my plan.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 D takes E5.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Okay.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Once again,

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 draw offer.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Queen H4.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 So if you really think about it,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 this is actually pretty similar to the 100 moves challenge.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Link in the description.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Because if I give him enough advantage,

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 there is no way that he's going to accept my draw offer.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Therefore,

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 my plan is,

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I will sacrifice my queen to give him a huge lead in material,

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 and then try to fight my way back,

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 or even try to checkmate his king,

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 which should be stuck in the middle of the board.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 D3.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Ah ha!

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 He's trying to get me to play queen E4,

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 which forks his rook and his pawn on E5,

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 and then he'll play knight F3,

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 which defends both threats,

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 and then he'll laugh into my face.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Ha ha, I tricked you!

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 You random 100 rated noob who starts the game by developing your woman.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And by the way,

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 it happens with my previous videos,

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 that a lot of people were mad about the fact that I kept calling my opponent as he,

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 when the profile picture was featuring a woman instead.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Well,

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I guess you do have a point there.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But how about a guy using his girlfriend's picture,

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 or his sister's picture,

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 or his ex-girlfriend's picture,

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 or his random female neighbor's picture,

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 or his mom's picture,

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 or even his random female neighbor's boyfriend's mom's picture.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 So I guess,

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 you cannot prove that I'm wrong.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Well,

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 technically, I also cannot prove that you're wrong.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 So I guess let's just ignore it together.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Anyway,

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 back to the game.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Again,

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 my plan was to sacrifice my queen,

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 and even though my best choice is queen takes F2 has been blocked,

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 there is still

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 draw offer.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Queen takes H2.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 If his rook moves,

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 he also cannot castle kingside.

73
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Rook takes H2.

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Yes.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Now that he has a ton of material advantage,

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 there is no way this video is going to end,

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 and I will try to make my second 10-minute video on this channel.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Draw offer,

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 knight C3.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Well,

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 I guess I'll have to draw something.

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 [Music]

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Guess who?

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:35,000

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,340
