00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 I'm better than my viewers? Waterloo. Too many pieces, but it's fine. Morning everyone,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,480
 welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers, and the viewer this time is a guy called

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,800
 Wanch SB. I'll take this horsey. I mean taking a free piece with the tempo on attacking his rook

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,480
 can never be a bad decision. Rook h6. Ah ha, he saw that I was having a double attack on his rook

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,720
 and his knight, so he decided to counterattack on my bishop. So I guess, bishop takes f7 check.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:41,440
 King takes, now I can take this knight. Rook takes a4. Man. I thought we were having fun on this

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,280
 side, somehow he decided to transfer over to that side. Knight g4. No, I want to play on this side.

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:57,200
 Okay it's that side then. Rook takes. Rook h5. I'll take this pawn, it's funny that the

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,520
 plank pawns are not protected in this position even though both sides have a lot of rooks.

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:10,160
 Rook a6. Rook a3. The rooks protect each other through their x-ray vision. Rook takes a3.

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,440
 Rook takes a3. I mean if he can also let me infiltrate his backline right now,

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,960
 that will be very convenient.

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,960
 Well, I guess we can all agree, that a viewer obviously cannot be a paid actor. Rook takes a8.

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:35,120
 Knight a6. That knight is actually trapped in the very first place. b5. Knight takes g4.

15
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:43,600
 I'll take that knight first. Rook a6. Ah ha. I'll take this pawn. And then he said,

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:52,640
 man I don't know whether I should accept the sack or not. Brah. Queen takes. That blunders a queen.

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,760
 Knight e5 royal fork. In case some of you guys didn't see it, bishop takes d7 was not a sacrifice

18
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,800
 because his bishop was pinned by my rook and his d-pawn was also indirectly attacked by my knight

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:12,400
 on d3 through a potential future check. And if you still don't understand anything, well, it's fine.

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,800
 King d6. Swoosh and sook. f5 check. I mean who knows, maybe he'll decide to go king d6 which

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,560
 blunders knight f7 checkmate in one with the king in the middle of the board.

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:41,120
 Again, not a paid actor. Knight f7. Checkmate. I'm better than my viewers.

23
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:49,040
