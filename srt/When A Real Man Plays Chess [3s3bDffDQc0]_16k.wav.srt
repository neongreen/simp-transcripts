00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 100 rated chess, but it's pure testosterone. Every move needs to be f***ing giga chad level of testosterone.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Ha, if I have to choose one challenge that represent my personality, it has to be this one.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 We get a 168 from the United Kingdom. Pushing pawn 1 square doesn't sound very giga chad.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 E4. E5. Now I get to choose the opening, and there is no opening that can be more giga chad, than king E2.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Come at me you coward.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Knight F6. Ah ha, that knight is attacking my pawn, but developing a knight to defend it doesn't sound very giga chad.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 So you know what, I'll defend it with my f***ing king.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Knight takes E4. Ah ha, he is literally challenging me to advance my king forward, and as a giga chad, I cannot say no.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 King takes E4. Is best. Absolutely amazing.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 C6. Ah ha, he is once again trying to challenge me to keep advancing my king, and also once again, I'm not going to refuse it.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Fun fact, king E5 is actually blundering a king to D5. King D4. Queen F6. King D3. Bishop F5. King E3. Queen E6. King F4. Queen E4. King G5. H6. King H5. G6.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 A very textbook checkmate in 7 with a pawn, but there's no way he's seeing it. Right?

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Absolutely. King D4 and king F4 should be safe, but as a giga chad, I'll keep my king on the open file.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 This also blunders another textbook checkmate in 7 that I'm not gonna show here because everyone can see it.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 So let's see if he sees D5, he does. Retreating the king sounds very cowardly. King E5. Queen F6 checkmate in 1 by the way.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Ha! Now I'm forced to move my king back. Queen E4 check. King C3 is forced.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Again, I'm not a coward, I'm being forced to make these moves.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And there it is, the long-awaited woman blunder.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 C5. I'll take this pawn. A capture is 100% a giga chad move.

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Resignation.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Mission accomplished.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:42,000
