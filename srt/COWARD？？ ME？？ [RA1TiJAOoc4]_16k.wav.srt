1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 100 rated chess, but your opponent is a grandmaster. You cannot touch his pieces,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,440
 not pawns, because you're a coward and scared of him. Okay the first thing is, I am 100% not a

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,800
 coward, and the second thing is that I suppose we only consider these 4 squares are actually

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,240
 touching a piece, because if all 8 squares are chosen, the challenge will become way too difficult.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,520
 And again, I'm not a coward, we get a 2 46 from Saudi Arabia. E4, pushing a pawn is pretty risky

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,240
 because he can move a piece to touch my pawn and I cannot move the pawn away to avoid it,

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:48,000
 but to prove that I'm not a coward, such risky play is definitely necessary. E5. D4. Queen F6.

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:55,200
 Aha, D take C5 will only provoke him to take back, which makes Edward touches his queen, and even

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:02,000
 though Edward seems to like it a lot, I have to ignore him for the video's sake. Knight F3. I mean

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,680
 queen F4 ends the video, but since it obviously blunders a queen, there's no way he'll play that

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:18,480
 move, right? No doubt. C3. Bishop D6. Dude, if you look at the situation, you can actually see

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,120
 that I cannot take this pawn with my pawn, I cannot take this pawn with my knight, I cannot

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,160
 attack his queen, I cannot push this pawn, I literally cannot do anything. Knight D2 then,

14
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,600
 I mean there is no reason to play a move like queen F4, so I guess I'm not gonna worry about

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:46,640
 it anymore. E takes D4. C takes D4. Knight E7. Aha, that blunders a fork, in no world do you

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:55,760
 move your queen here instead of making a desperado. Thank you. D takes E5. Okay, now there are like

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,280
 2000 different queen moves, so please just don't take one of the only 2 moves that can end the

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,360
 video, and to be honest, if you can just blunder your queen right here, that will be very convenient.

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,760
 Okay, that is absolutely fine. Bishop E2, let's just play as safe as possible.

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:23,120
 F6. I'll take it, if he plays king F7 just to end my video right here,

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,520
 I'm down to just never play chess again.

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:38,480
 Ha, always have faith in the 100 rated players. Castle. Queen D5. Very aggressive. Rook E1,

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,880
 just please don't take anything crazy. Rook G8. Aha, he is obviously trying to attack my king,

24
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:53,360
 therefore, bishop C4. I'm skewering his queen and his rook, and since he has such a great idea to

25
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,520
 attack my king, he should obviously go queen C6 or queen H5 to continue attacking my king instead

26
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:06,320
 of a random move like queen C5 which has no use at all beside ending my video. Right?

27
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,400
 *Pause*

28
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,160
 What the f-

29
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:27,460
 *Outro*
