00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 If a piece, not pawn, doesn't protect anything, the video is unprotected.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,560
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account. Let's go, we get a 1 17 from Canada.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,480
 So now the most obvious threats are pushing the center pawns, because a move like e4 will

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,880
 make his g1 knight not protect anything, which means it ends the video. No, that is not fair,

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:36,560
 so let's just say, that the knights in starting position, doesn't count. And with that said,

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:45,760
 the video continues. Bishop b5 is obviously the next threat. So I guess, a6. Well, actually,

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,840
 a move like g3 also make his bishop not protecting anything, which is also unfair,

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,080
 since I cannot do anything about it, so let's change it to, the entire starting position,

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,160
 doesn't count. And I'm not a coward, it's just to make the rules a bit fairer.

10
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:14,880
 Knight c3. e5. Again, the starting position, doesn't count. Bishop c4. For those of you

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:25,680
 who can't see, this bishop is still guarding this pawn. Knight c6. Queen h5. Very aggressive. g6.

12
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:37,840
 Queen f5. That blunders a queen. e takes f5. d5. Oh wait I blundered a pawn. I mean taking his

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,720
 queen made my adrenaline rise so high that I couldn't properly control myself. Bishop takes.

14
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:54,640
 It's fine, it's just a small pawn anyway. Knight ce7. Bishop takes f7 check. Man,

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:02,080
 look at this bishop. It went from f1, to c4, to d5, to f7. And then to hell.

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:15,760
 Knight e2. Not very aggressive. I'll take this pawn. d3. Bishop g7. Oh, wait. My bad.

17
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:27,200
 Ha! Not even close. h6. And the best thing is, there is no way he can end my video anymore.

18
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,800
 What the f-

19
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:49,440
