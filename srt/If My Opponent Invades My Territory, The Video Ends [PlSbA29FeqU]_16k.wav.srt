1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 If my opponent moves a piece, not pawn, over the middle of the board, the video ends.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Well, that sounds impossible to accomplished, but since I'm out of ideas, let's find an opponent.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 We get a 2 or 5 from the US. With diamond membership.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 D4.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Ah ha! Now he has bishop g5, invading my side of the board, which ends the video.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 So I guess...

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 H6.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 E4.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Very aggressive.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Now he also has bishop b5, and queen h5, ending the video.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 But sadly there is no way I can prevent both of them. So let's think about this carefully.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Normally, no one develops their queen first, so preventing bishop b5 should make more sense.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But since people usually only play bishop b5 when there is a knight on c6, that move now should be less likely to happen.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 And you know, there are a lot of other squares for his bishop as well.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So I guess...

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 G6.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Bishop c4.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Yes!

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 And now, there are still 2 threats, but both of them can easily be stopped.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 With c6.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Queen f3.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Let's not blunder checkmate in 1.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 E6.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And the best thing is, there is no more threat to the video.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 D5.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Very aggressive.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Of course I cannot take that pawn, since my pawns are guarding some important squares for the video.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Therefore, bishop g7.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Knight c3.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Knight e7.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 I'm provoking d6, which is a really strong move, but it will cancel all the tension in the middle of the board, which is good for the video.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 And he chose to capture instead.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Alright. It's still probably good.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 I'll take this way.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Knight h3.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I'll castle.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Castle.

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 G5.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 I want to absolutely shut down his horsey on h3.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Oh!

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Wait!

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Ha ha!

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Not only he didn't play that move, he also blocked his queen view towards that square.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 E5.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Let's take some center, and then somehow try to counterattack.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Rook d1.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Queen b6.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Oh!

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Wait!

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Did I blunder bishop takes g5?

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Nah!

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 There's no way he's going to see it.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Oh wait again!

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Maybe he won't be able to see bishop g5, but there is rook d6 ending the video.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 What's wrong with me today? I keep blundering the video every move.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Thank god!

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 b4.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Very aggressive.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 But anyway.

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 That blunders a pawn.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 And the best part is, my queen now guards the d6 square, and bishop takes g5 is no longer a threat, since after h takes g5, knight takes g5 is blundering a bishop.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 This is such a perfect situation.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 I mean I have made a lot of blunders today, but this guy is obviously helping me a lot with my video.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 *click*

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 What the f-

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:00,000
