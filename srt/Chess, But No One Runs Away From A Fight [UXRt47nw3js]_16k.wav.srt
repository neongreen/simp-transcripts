 100 rated chess. But if a piece, or pawn, is attacked, it gets immobilized.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:18,480
 This is hard. But anyway, let's find an opponent.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,400
 We get a 2 51 from Australia. E4.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,140
 E5. So far so good.

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,780
 Knight f3. F6.

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:39,460
 That blunders a pawn, oh wait wait wait. If I take his pawn, he takes my knight.

7
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,240
 Queen h5 check. G6 will attack and immobilize my queen, which

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,180
 prevents me from going queen e5 forking his king and rook.

9
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:54,440
 And even worse, he can win my queen on his next move.

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,500
 So I guess, d4. c5.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,620
 That blunders a pawn. But sadly, since my d-pawn is being attacked

12
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:14,460
 by his pawns, it cannot move. So I guess, c3.

13
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,040
 He takes d4. I want to take that pawn back, but again,

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,080
 my c-pawn is being attacked, so it cannot move.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,820
 This mission is getting very wrong very quickly.

16
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:36,860
 Therefore, let's just gambit some more pawns, I mean who cares about the pawns anyway.

17
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,820
 Bishop to c4. Knight c6.

18
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,060
 Ah, just as I said no one cares about the pawns, he shows me that he not only cares

19
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,340
 about his pawns, but also cares about my pawns.

20
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:59,720
 He's such a pawn lover. But anyway, I still don't care.

21
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:04,260
 Bishop f4. I'm trying to bait him into playing g5, which

22
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,380
 should even give me a chance to checkmate him.

23
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,500
 g5. Yes.

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,100
 That blunders a lot. Knight takes g5.

25
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:23,280
 Please take my knight and loose. And since he cares so much about the pawns,

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,520
 I believe he will take my knight to avenge his dead g-pawn.

27
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,060
 And he did. Wow.

28
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,620
 I really can't believe that I have just finished such an impossible mission.

29
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,980
 Queen h5 check. And I can pre-move.

30
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:51,180
 Queen f7. Checkmate.

31
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,820
 Mission accomplished.

32
00:02:53,180 --> 00:03:07,740
