1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
 Alright, since we've finished setting up the board, let's decide how the things are gonna move.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,280
 Okay then, I guess we should start with the soldiers.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,740
 Yeah, that sounds fair.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,000
 But I suggest we should come up with a good name to call them other than soldiers.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,820
 Oh, that sounds like an absolutely wonderful idea.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:21,500
 This way we can show our respect to our soldiers by calling them in a more respectful way, pawns.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,520
 You know, I actually think that the word pawn sounds like a downgrade from soldiers.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,300
 And that is exactly what I meant.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,020
 Okay then.

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,200
 Okay cool, so back to the original plan of deciding how these pawns should be moving around in our game.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,800
 Yeah, so my suggestion is that they should be allowed to go in straight lines in any directions they want but it's only one square.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,680
 Oh wait, that sounds like what we do.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,400
 Well, I mean all human beings are the same so they obviously can do whatever we can.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,220
 Well, but we're technically in charge here and they are our pawns so they shouldn't be on equal power as us, right?

15
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,180
 Okay, so tell me your suggestion.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,200
 I suggest they only move forward. All the other directions are forbidden.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,460
 Oh my god that sounds like a massive downgrade from my suggestion.

18
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,580
 No wait wait wait. How about we let them move two squares in their first move?

19
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,980
 Well okay now that sounds a bit more fair.

20
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,900
 But how about also allowing them to go backward?

21
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:21,380
 I mean sometimes they also need to go back to their home to visit their lovely wife and son who are always waiting for them to come back.

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,880
 No.

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,980
 Okay that's fair. So I guess we also agree that they attack forward the same as they move right?

24
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,800
 Oh no no no no. I'll say they attack diagonally.

25
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,580
 Wait that doesn't make any sense.

26
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:42,480
 Yeah you know, a bit of controversy. They go forward, and then when the opponent offside is not paying attention to them, our useless pawns can deliver the unexpected strike.

27
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:48,900
 Oh I don't think we should be making these pawns so complicated as we also have the generals who haven't been decided how to move yet.

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,660
 Oh you know what, let's make it even more complicated by adding something very weird in their way of attacking.

29
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,700
 Oh no I don't like where this is going but please go ahead.

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,340
 Yeah I'll say that we should add something French.

31
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,020
 Wait what are the French doing here?

32
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:10,300
 Oh you know I always like to add French stuff into things. Like a little bit of French here, a little bit of French there. It makes things perfect.

33
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,620
 Well I guess we should just leave this French topic for another day.

34
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,660
 Yeah that's fine too. Now how about we come up with some names for the pawns?

35
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,140
 Wait didn't their parents already give them a name when they were born?

36
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:29,020
 Yeah I mean they did but don't you think it takes too much time to go out and ask each and every one of those pawns what their name is and try to remember it?

37
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,620
 Oh that's right there are just too many of them out there.

38
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,260
 Yeah I can't even count.

39
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:40,900
 Okay so the pawn in the A section should have a name that starts with an A. Okay let's see. How about...

40
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:49,780
 Ah. Rah. Nah. Rah. Oh that sounds like a great name but it somehow makes me feel like I have a lot of things to do.

41
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,780
 But don't you think that it also sounds very friendly and related a lot to music?

42
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,020
 Okay so let's just leave the A pawn for another day. How about the B pawn?

43
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,100
 Okay so it starts with a B? Yeah let's come up with something very creative. Okay let's see.

44
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,740
 Bomb. Bomb. Bah.

45
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,740
 Coup d'un?

46
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
 What the f-

47
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,700
 What the f-

48
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:27,060
