1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 If I can't play the best move,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 or book move,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 the video ends.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Disclaimer.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 I don't judge the moves myself,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 the evaluations of the moves are decided by Stockfish,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 one of the chess.com engines.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And I only use the engine to analyze the game after it is already done,

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 which means I don't cheat during the game.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Alright.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 The truth is, I actually came up with this idea a long time ago.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 But of course, this is just way too hard,

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 especially at the 180 D low,

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 where people don't usually make book moves.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 But sadly, when ideas are running out,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I need to take on the unthinkable.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 And with that out of the way,

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 let's find an opponent.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 We get a 293 from the US,

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 with premiumed membership.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Man.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I've been facing a lot of Americans these days,

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 which makes me miss all the fun I used to have with the Indians.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 But anyway,

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 it's not like I can choose my opponent in the first place,

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 so let's just play the game.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Since the challenge requires me to play

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 either best

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 or book moves,

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 I think I should start with the most famous move,

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 written in the books.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 E4.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 D5.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Dude.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 As I was planning to play theoretically,

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 he gave me an opening, that brings out his queen.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Okay then.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Nf3.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 If this is what he wants,

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I would prefer to do it this way.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Tennis and gambit,

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 and I'll try to go for the intercontinental ballistic missile variation.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 He took it.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Ng5.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Nh6.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Okay I guess that's out of theory.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 From now on,

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 things are going to be hard.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 First things first.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Taking this pawn

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 should be best.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 But of course,

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 we still need stockfish to confirm that.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Yes.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Bf5.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Bishop f5.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Ah ha!

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 This one should be easy.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Ng3.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Stockfish?

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Thank you.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 E6.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Okay.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Now comes the hard part.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 There are so many choices.

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 D3.

68
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 D4.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Nc3.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Be2.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Bc4.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Bb5.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Or Ke2.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Well I'm pretty sure Ke2 is not really a choice,

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 but subtracting one choice out of a hundred is not really that much of a deal.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Alright.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 I guess I can just trust my instinct.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 D4.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Stockfish?

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Ha ha!

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 I'm such a grandmaster.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Bd6.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I have faith in this one.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Bxh6.

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 But of course,

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 we still need stockfish to decide that.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Yes.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Gxh6.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 I'll take this one as well.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 There is no way this is wrong.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Right?

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Thank you fish.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 He takes f5.

94
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Alright.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Now comes the hard part again.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 I need to make a developing move.

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I mean Bd3 looks really good,

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 but Qh5 is forking the f-pawn and the h-pawn,

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 and Qf3 is forking the f-pawn and the b-pawn.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Alright.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 I guess I need to trust my instinct again.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Qf3.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Even though Qh5 hits the most amount of targets,

104
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Qg5 is such a good move to cancel all of them.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 But in order to stop Qf3,

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 the only possible move

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 is Qc8,

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 which looks absurd.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 But of course,

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 we still need stockfish to decide whether I'm right or not.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 (Quack)

112
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 What the f-

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 (Outro)
