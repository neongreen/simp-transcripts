1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 If neither player's pawn structure contains a Tetris piece,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 the video ends.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Very interesting.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 For those of you who don't know what Tetris is,

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 it's basically a Russian game, made in the 80s.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 But anyway, for this video, we only have to care about the Tetris pieces,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 not the gameplay.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 There are 5 types of pieces like this.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Of course you can spin them around as well.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 If no one's pawn structure contains a shape like one of these shapes,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 the video ends.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 We get a 139 from Australia,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 with premium membership.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 E4.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 The plan is simple.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 All I have to do, is to keep these 4 pawns untouched,

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 so they will always look like this Tetris piece.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 E5.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Knight F3.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 So far so good.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 D5.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 I'll take it then.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Can't just allow him to have 2 strong center pawns.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Bishop C5.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I'll take this pawn as well.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Bishop F5.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Knight F3.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 If he takes the pawn on C2, the video ends,

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 but since he has premium membership,

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 I believe that chess.com has already given him a lesson or two about the Scholar's Mate.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Right?

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Yep.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 He found it.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Not only he didn't take the pawn on C2,

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 but he also used his queen to defend the F pawn.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 But anyway,

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 he's as slummed as a bishop.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Knight D7.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 He's offering a trade, and of course I'll take it.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Queen takes.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Knight takes.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 King E7.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 That looks like a mouse slip.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 But still, I don't care.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Knight takes C5.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Like no one once said,

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 if your opponent mouse slipped,

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 destroy them.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Rook E8.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Very aggressive.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 He's obviously planning to go King D6,

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 with a discovered check on my king,

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 and then king takes C5,

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 willing to expose his king to the middle of the board,

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 just to win back a piece.

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 But of course, I don't want to lose my horsey.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Bishop E2.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Since I already lost 2 pieces due to the challenge's rules,

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 losing 1 more is not really an option.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 King D8.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Knight C3.

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Knight F6.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Ah ha!

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 He's obviously baiting me to castle,

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 and then he'll go knight takes D5,

67
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 knight takes D5,

68
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 distracting my knight away from my bishop,

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 and then taking my bishop,

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 thus winning a pawn.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 So I guess, instead of castling,

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I'll take a free pawn.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 King C8.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Knight A5.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Rook E5.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Knight to C6.

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Oh no my pawn!

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Wow!

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 I was baiting him to go knight takes D5,

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 knight takes D5,

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 rook takes D5,

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 and then I'll have knight E7,

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 forking his king and his rook.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 But he then saw through that line,

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 and played rook H2 E8,

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 preventing my knight from going to E7,

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 thus also threatening to take my D5 pawn on his next move.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 So I guess, F4.

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Oh, wait.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Okay nobody saw that.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Rook takes E2 check.

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Knight takes.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 To this point, I can 100% sure that this video is going to be another victory for me,

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 if I can just finish the game before my time runs out.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Knight takes D5.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Rook F1.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Rook E4.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 G3.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 King D7.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 Knight E5 check.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 King to E6.

102
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Very aggressive.

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Knight back to F3.

104
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I'm threatening to fork him on G5.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And he's inviting me to do it.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Of course then.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 King F5.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 I'll take his rook of course.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 King takes G4.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 F5.

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 After all of those videos,

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 I have finally done it again.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 D3 check.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Mate.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 This is the second time I have done this,

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 winning the game, by breaking the rules.

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And since I have broken the rules myself,

118
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 there is no what the f*** today.

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 Thanks for watching.

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 I hope you enjoyed.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 See you next time.

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
