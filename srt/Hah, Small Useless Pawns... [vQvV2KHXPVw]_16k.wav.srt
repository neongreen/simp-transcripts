00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 100 rated chess, but if an opponent's pawn... not piece, attacks one of your pieces... not pawns...

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,080
 the video ends. Ha! This is obviously one of the easiest challenges ever. We get a 170 from Germany.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:26,080
 Man. No offense, but this guy has to be the lowest rated German out there. E4. E5. D4.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,200
 Since the pawns are the only things that can end my video, the best plan is obviously to trade all

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:40,320
 of them down. Or not. I'll take it this way. E takes. Ah ha! Now queen takes is obviously the

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,120
 best move, but then there is a big chance that he'll play c5 to end my video. Therefore, knight f3.

7
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:56,320
 Queen e7. Wow! If I block with this bishop, I'm ending my own video. If I block with queen or

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,920
 this bishop, d3 also ends the video. So I guess, we have no other choices. Come at me baby!

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,760
 Ha! Coward. Now I'll take this pawn. I mean c5 does end the video,

10
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,560
 but since he is obviously a coward, I bet he will never play that move in this entire game.

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:29,280
 Of course. C3. Bishop a5. B4. Queen g5 check. That blunders a bishop. King c2. Well I mean if he

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,960
 moves his bishop now and blunders his queen, I may not dare to take it because of f6 or h6 ending

13
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:46,480
 the video, but who plays like that anyway? Right? No doubt. B takes a5. Ha! And now I'll take this

14
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,520
 bishop. And even better, now he should be able to see, that c5 is just asking for knight b5

15
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,960
 threatening a triple fork so he'll have to move his queen again. Right? Of course he sees it.

16
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:08,480
 C4. Queen takes c4 check. That blunders a woman. Alright, now he should once again be able to see,

17
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,560
 that c5 is just blundering a very obvious checkmate in 9 after a key 1 check. Right?

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,320
 He sees everything. Rook e1 anyway. Ha! And just like that, there is no good way for him to end my

19
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,840
 video anymore.

20
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,120
 What the f-

21
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,920
 video anymore.

22
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,420
 What the f-

23
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:47,980
