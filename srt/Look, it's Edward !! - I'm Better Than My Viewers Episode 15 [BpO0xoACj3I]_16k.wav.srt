00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 I'm better than my viewers, but I'm being a little overprotective with Edward.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,120
 Let's go! Welcome to episode 15 of I'm better than my viewers, and the challenger this time

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,920
 is a guy called Cheems Musashi. Let's take this rook. You know what they say, there's no better

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,600
 way to win a chess game than taking your opponent's rook on the first move. Queen takes rook. Ah ha,

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,560
 he's obviously threatening queen h6 check rook g5 queen takes g5 checkmate in two. Therefore,

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,960
 knight f5. Man after those previous 14 episodes, I do know that people really like to make same

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,880
 colored bishops, but this guy just took things to a whole new level, by making 6 same colored

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:53,440
 bishops, and all got blocked by the same f***ing pawn. Rook takes g4. Knight takes g4. Well I mean

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:02,240
 at least my knights are active. Queen g5 check. King f2 is forced. Queen g h4 check. I'll take

10
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:07,920
 that queen, I don't even think that was a blunder though, he actively did that to flex that he has

11
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:16,720
 more materials than I do. Queen d takes h4 check. King f1. Okay I do know that blunders are horsey,

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,400
 but somehow I felt that king g1 is a massive blunder, so I chose to stick to my instinct

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:31,760
 and sacrifice my horsey for the greater good. The horsey is dead. Queen 1 f2. Queen h4. Okay you know

14
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:38,720
 what, this side is getting out of control, how about this. Knight d5, I'll attract his attention

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,680
 towards the other side, and let's just hope that it will stop the attack on my king. Exactly as

16
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,240
 planned. Knight b6, I mean if he can take my rook right now and blunders 2 queens at the same time

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,320
 instead of 1, that will be very convenient. Of course it doesn't happen. Rook takes a8, take

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:10,000
 this rook, please. Not very convenient. Rook a4. Queen back to b8. I need to double up my rooks on

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 the a-file, therefore, rook a3, rook a4 coming next, and actually, I think I've just blundered a rook.

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,000
 Yeah, I blundered a rook. This is embarrassing.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,120
 Okay to my defense, I actually got a really bad stomachache at that time, so maybe that was what

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,040
 got me blundered my rook, and I have absolutely no fault here. Let's give a check. King d7.

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,360
 Bishop b3. Okay at least now these bishops can finally see some light instead of Edwards but,

24
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:56,080
 rook g7, queen d3, d a3, queen e3, queen h3, very aggressive. Wow. If I don't take his queen now,

25
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:02,720
 people are gonna dislike the video and say that I'm a coward. Therefore, bishop takes h3. King

26
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,560
 run coming up next, queen h3, king e1, queen h4, king d1, can't catch me baby, queen h2, ah ha,

27
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,320
 he wants his queen to be active on my second rank, so I guess, I'll block away the view.

28
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:21,440
 I'm down for a rook versus 2 bishops trade, especially since these bishops have been doing

29
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,880
 nothing but looking at Edwards right butt cheek the entire game. Queen h6. Man, even my opponent

30
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:37,120
 doesn't like these useless bishops. I'll take this pawn. King e7 testosterone. And you know what?

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:45,520
 I think I have a great idea. Knight f1. Oh no my darling. Woman down. No worries,

32
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:54,240
 I still have one more. Queen d7 king f6 queen f5 king e7 queen d7 king f6 queen f5 king e7 queen

33
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,160
 d7 check and it is a draw by repetition. And since that was a draw when I'm having a worse

34
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,320
 position at the start of the game, I'm better than my viewers.

35
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:18,960
