1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 If my opponent plays the best move, the video ends.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Disclaimer. I only used Chess.com's engine to analyze the game after it is already done, which means I didn't cheat during the game.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Now, back to the video.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Ok. To be honest, I'm pretty sure this video is not going to last long.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 But of course, that always depends on my luck.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Therefore, let's find an opponent.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 We get a 163 from Brazil.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 D4. Ah ha. That is considered to be the best opening move, with E4 as an alternative.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 But of course, according to Stockfish, it is...

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 a book move.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 And as far as I can see, a book move cannot be considered as a best move.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Therefore, the video survives.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 In order to make this video long, I believe I should be playing as tricky as possible.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Therefore, E5. The trickiest opening against D4 that I know.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 The England gambit.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 B3.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Well, the theory ends pretty fast.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Since we all know that accepting the gambit is the best move, there's no need to check if B3 is a best move.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 But the problem is, what do I have to do now?

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 I mean if I just leave the pawn here, he'll take it next turn, and even though that move should have been a book move, it will become a best move, since we are out of theory.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 But if I play knight C6 to defend it, D5 is obviously the best move, and is easy to see as well.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Also, if I just take his pawn first, queen takes is obviously the best move, and is also very easy to see.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Therefore, I guess I have to go...

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 E4.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 And ha ha! Now even I don't know what his best move is, so I have a good faith that he's not going to see it either.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Ba3.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 That move looks okay, but let's see what Stockfish has to say.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Ah ha! It's excellent, but not quite the best move.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 But anyway. If I take his bishop, knight takes back is very natural, which should also be the best move.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But if I just leave it like this, his bishop taking mine, can also be a best move.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Therefore, D6.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 And again, I don't even see what his best move is, so let's just say, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 E3.

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 That's a fine move. I mean it looks kinda slow, but of course, we still need Stockfish to check that out.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 What?

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 What the f-

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:44,000
