 I'm better than my viewers, Fortress. Looks fun. Welcome to episode 13 of I'm better than my

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,840
 viewers, and the challenger this time is a guy called Star on Da Great, exclamation mark.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,360
 I will be playing black this game, and even though Stockfish is saying that black has the advantage,

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,640
 we all know that it is not true, because all these queens are going to die. So black actually

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,240
 only has some same color bishops and a few knights, which is pretty impossible to deliver a checkmate.

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,680
 B takes a3 discovered check. Queen blocks is forced, well I mean if he can just play c3 to

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,840
 block his own bishop, that will be very convenient. Of course it doesn't happen. Queen takes is forced,

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,040
 c3 best move by the way. Or not. Ah ha, now I can go king takes to save my queen,

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,640
 but then there is still knight a4 check king a2 knight c3 royal fork anyway, and I believe

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:06,480
 that situation is actually even worse for my king, therefore, queen takes b2. Bishop fe5.

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:12,240
 Of course there's no reason to take his bishop, so I'll take this knight instead. As long as this

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,880
 thing is still on the board, there is always a chance that he'll mess up. Nevermind. King takes.

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,560
 Stockfish obviously doesn't know how to evaluate this position, because now I have to somehow keep

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,960
 all of my horses alive, and just for context, there is already one about to die. Bishop f6 check.

15
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,520
 King takes c2. Ah ha, now please go knight d4 check and then take my bishop so that I can move

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:46,560
 my knight out of danger. This guy is totally destroying me right now. I'll take this horsey,

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,400
 oh, wait. Maybe I should have taken this pawn first. Yeah, that was unfortunate. I have to

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:02,000
 take that. It's fine, my knight didn't really have any moves anyway. Another horse dies. Knight takes

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,320
 g2. Alright, at least these 2 guys are safe, let's just hope that they can make it all the way to

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:18,720
 the white king. B4. Bishop c4. Need to stop those pawns first. King h6. Ah ha, that king obviously

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,920
 wants to run out of the fortress, therefore, knight takes d2. Alright, now just go king g5

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:36,160
 and give me a free tempo to go knight f3. And he saw it. Knight f3 anyway. King g7. Ha, after an

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,440
 unsuccessful attempt to break out, he has become really sad and decided to go back inside the

24
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,680
 prison. But anyway, it was in this position, I decided that there is no way I can checkmate him

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,400
 with this limited amount of materials, so I offered a draw, and surprisingly, he actually declined the

26
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,520
 offer. Yeah, even this 900 rated guy knows that he is the one having the advantage here, not me.

27
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:10,720
 Bishop g6, just a random move, I needed time to think. Bishop ef6. Knight e1, that is one of the

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:18,320
 3 safe dark squares left on the entire board. Knight takes e4. Ah ha, that move is threatening

29
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,920
 to win my knight, and even though there is knight d3, my knight won't be able to go anywhere after

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,120
 that, therefore, let's take a risk. Bishop takes e4, I'm removing my bishop from controlling the

31
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,800
 b5 square, so let's just hope that he'll push these pawns to give me some free moves to develop my

32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:44,240
 knight. Maybe not. And now since I only have one knight left, there is absolutely no way I can

33
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:51,040
 checkmate him, so after just 2 more moves, we agree to a draw. Which is to say, that, I'm better than

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,840
 my viewers, and if you don't agree that I'm better because Stockfish said that I have the advantage

35
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,200
 from the start, well, who cares.

36
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:13,760
