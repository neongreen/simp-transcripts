1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
 It's December 10th, and according to Google, it's the...

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,800
 No.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:13,000
 Aha! According to some other websites, it's the Human Rights Day.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,800
 And now I know that people support alcohol more than human rights.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,800
 But anyway, with that said, today's challenge is, if a porn dies, the video ends.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,400
 Because you know, nothing is cheaper than a porn, and Netflix actually even made a movie called,

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,100
 "The Queen's Gambit", which is literally letting a porn die.

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,900
 Writers move number 2.

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,800
 Therefore today, I will fight for porn rights.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,800
 We get a 274 from India.

11
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,800
 Since no porn is allowed to die, pushing porns is definitely not the smartest idea.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,600
 Night F3.

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,200
 E5.

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:05,700
 Ha! Just as I'm doing a challenge about saving the porns, he decided to sacrifice a porn, on his first move.

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,600
 Gross Gambit.

16
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,100
 B3.

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,100
 Night F6.

18
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,900
 That blunders this porn again.

19
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,600
 But anyway,

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,300
 Bishop B2.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,600
 Bishop C5.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,800
 That is still blundering that very porn, but this time, it's in two different ways.

23
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,700
 This video is going very wrong very quickly.

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
 H3.

25
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:40,800
 Fun fact, when I analyze the game with Stockfish, it thinks that my last 3 moves are all mistakes,

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,700
 due to the fact that I didn't take the free porn.

27
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,900
 F*** you Stockfish.

28
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,400
 Night E4.

29
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,700
 Okay now things get serious.

30
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,900
 He's obviously targeting my F porn, which is also a checkmate in 1.

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,500
 And even though I really don't want to play it,

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,300
 I guess I don't have any other choices.

33
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,500
 E3.

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:09,300
 Okay so I've seen a lot of people don't realize that this porn blocks away the Bishop's view,

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,400
 but let's just hope, that this guy does.

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,300
 What the f***?

37
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:34,500
 [Outro]
