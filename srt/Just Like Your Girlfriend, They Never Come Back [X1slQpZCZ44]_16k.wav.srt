1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
 100 rated chess, but once your piece, or pawn, crosses the halfway mark, it cannot come back

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,440
 to your half.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,640
 Oh.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
 Wait.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,320
 My bad.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,700
 To be honest, I think this challenge is way too easy, because if you remember, I even

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,080
 have a video where I defeated my opponent without even going past the halfway line.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,480
 Therefore, let's add.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,720
 For your opponents.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
 Let's go.

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,400
 We get a 1-8-e-5 from Canada.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,120
 E3.

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,920
 Not very aggressive.

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,080
 E5.

15
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,080
 Knight F3.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,640
 Ah ha.

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,480
 He's obviously provoking E4 kicking his knight around, but if I play E4, his knight may jump

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,040
 to my side of the board, which will put me in big danger that a retreat will immediately

19
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,200
 end the video.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
 You know what?

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,320
 A real man never retreats from a challenge.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,480
 E4.

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,000
 I mean there is also a chance that he will blunder his knight instead.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,480
 Right?

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,440
 Ha.

26
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
 What a noob.

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,160
 E takes F3.

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,480
 I mean he had his chance to end my video, but he chose to refuse it instead.

29
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,080
 G takes F3.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,040
 Bishop C5.

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,280
 E4.

32
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
 Very aggressive.

33
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,680
 Man.

34
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,600
 This guy really disrespects me doesn't he?

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,640
 In case you didn't notice, he actually has been playing the entire game in only 0.3,

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,640
 0.1, 0.1, and 0.1 seconds, which means he's been pre-moving the entire game.

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,760
 Therefore, let's teach him a lesson.

38
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,920
 Queen H4.

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,400
 Now my queen is in his side of the board.

40
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,140
 She cannot go back anymore, but I think she is actually very safe on H4 that there is

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,120
 no need for a retreat.

42
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
 Queen E2.

43
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
 D6.

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
 Oh.

45
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
 Wait.

46
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,720
 I blundered.

47
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,720
 Now there is queen B5 check, and after I defend the check, he can move his queen anywhere,

48
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,280
 including retreating it.

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,680
 Thank you.

50
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,440
 Let's take this pawn first.

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,360
 King D1 is forced.

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,080
 Queen takes F3 check.

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,600
 Knight E2.

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,720
 Playing his rook should be the best move, but as I mentioned before, queen B5 is a huge

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
 threat.

56
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,940
 Therefore, C6.

57
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,720
 His rook doesn't have anywhere to go anyway, so there's no need to rush.

58
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,660
 H3.

59
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,440
 Queen takes H1.

60
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,280
 Man, even after adding all your opponents to the challenge, this still seems way too

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,880
 easy.

62
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,040
 E5.

63
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,840
 That blunders a king.

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,720
 Queen takes F1.

65
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
 Checkmate.

66
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
 Wow.

67
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,720
 I guess since this is too easy, I'm not gonna say mission accomplished today.

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:17,680
