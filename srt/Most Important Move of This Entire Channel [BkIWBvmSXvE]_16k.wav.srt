00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge after one move.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,960
 That move will be very important. We get a 145 from Ukraine,

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,000
 and even though I'm very sorry about your situation over there and I hope you're safe with all my

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
 heart, I still have to beat you up in this game for the video's sake.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,880
 D4. The first move will decide my fate for this entire video,

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,480
 but since I have absolutely no idea what the challenge is, I guess let's just try to open up

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,400
 the center. E5. Alright, let's see what kind of disaster is going to happen.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:41,040
 Whichever piece or pawn you moved has to be alive for the entire game,

9
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,120
 you can't let it die at all costs.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,780
 Wow.

11
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:55,360
 Oh my f***ing god that was so f***ing scary holy f*** I can't believe I f***ing survived that f***.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,600
 E4. I mean the situation is still pretty much a massive disaster as my e-pawn has now arrived in

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,320
 his half the board, but this is obviously still better than ending the video on move 2.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,640
 Knight D2. D5. Since he didn't take it last time when it was free,

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,800
 there's no way he's taking it right now when it is defended. Right?

16
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:27,200
 No doubt. E3 is kinda forced, in no world do you play knight E4 here just to prevent my queen from

17
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,640
 defending my pawn and after I take your knight you decide to immediately take my pawn just before I

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:41,360
 can move my queen to defend it. No doubt. Qg5. H4 blundering Qg3 checkmate in 1 will be very

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,480
 convenient. Sadly he's not a paid actor. That blunders a horsey because she takes H3 is

20
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,240
 blundering Qh4 checkmate in 1, but since it's only been 6 moves into the game, I don't want

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,680
 to end this video too early. So I guess, Qh6, just because I've moved my queen, doesn't mean I'm not

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:10,240
 defending my pawn anymore. Knight back to G1. Knight D2 knight B1, knight H3 knight G1. Maybe

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:22,000
 this guy is Magnus Carlsen. Bd6. C4. Ah ha, that once again blunders Qh4 G3 Qg3 brilliant move Hg3

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,600
 bishop G3 checkmate in 3, but again, I don't want this video to end too early. Bishop G3 check.

25
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:38,080
 H takes G3 is forced. Queen takes H1. And I've just realized, that bishop takes E3 is defending

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:48,080
 this knight that I'm attacking. Now I feel like a paid actor. Ha! Nevermind. I'll take it this time.

27
00:02:49,040 --> 00:03:00,080
 G takes. Queen G1. My god that looks like a mouse slip. Queen F2. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:14,480
