1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 100 rated chess, but for every second your opponent spends, you spend 5.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,040
 That is too much.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,320
 Let's change it to 2.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,500
 Let's go.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,600
 We get a 168 from Chile.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,040
 Knight c3.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,320
 Ok.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,360
 2 seconds for the first move.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,200
 That doesn't look good.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,200
 e5.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:37,120
 1.9 times 2 is 3.8, so 4.2 seconds should be a pretty good attempt from me.

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,560
 5 seconds.

13
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,920
 Dude.

14
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,840
 It's just the opening, please move faster.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,760
 Knight c6.

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,240
 Dude, just push your pawn or something, it's just the first few moves.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,280
 d4.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,600
 My god.

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,800
 Just a pawn push, does it really need 6.5 seconds to make?

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:09,200
 6.5 times 2 is 13 seconds, and since we stopped at 2.45 last move, I now have to wait until

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
 2.31.

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,920
 Well, technically it's 2.32, but I would prefer to be a bit slower, rather than to

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,960
 greed for that 1 second, and then accidentally end my own video.

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,600
 e takes d4.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,440
 Ok now, my pawn is attacking your knight, so please move it to another square, or just

26
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,080
 take it with the other knight.

27
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:38,520
 Sir, most people start their games by moving a pawn, you started your game by moving your

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,680
 horses.

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,960
 And now the moment comes when you need to move them again, you decide to think more

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,040
 carefully about this.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,480
 Thank you.

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,640
 My god that took him almost 8 seconds.

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,640
 7.9 times 2 is 15.8, which is very close to 16, so I'll have to wait for 17 seconds,

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,160
 which makes it 2.14, since we left off at 2.31.

35
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,920
 Well, at least after I take his knight, he won't have to use too much time to take back

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,060
 with his queen.

37
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,760
 Knight takes d4.

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,320
 Why is he still thinking?

39
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,040
 Bishop f4.

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,520
 This guy used my 16.4 seconds to think, and then used an extra 8.7 seconds, to make a

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,280
 blunder.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,920
 Knight back to c6.

43
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,600
 Man, it's actually really hard to play the game, look at the time, remember the time

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,280
 checkpoints, and do maths at the same time.

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,040
 So if you are still watching until this point, please leave a like on the video, because

46
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,040
 this is much harder than anything I've ever done in my entire life.

47
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,960
 Except for trying to understand the women.

48
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
 Knight b5.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,640
 4.1 seconds.

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,160
 Oh, I was worrying that his time consumptions have been increasing since the beginning of

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,880
 the game, from 1.9, to 5, and then all the way to almost 9 seconds, but then now he makes

52
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,960
 a move that is faster than almost all of those moves.

53
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,640
 d6.

54
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,480
 Okay my friend, now make a move that is even faster than the last move.

55
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:36,680
 Okay it can't be faster than the last move anymore, so let's just make a move right now.

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,520
 Please just move.

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,040
 Queen d5.

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,920
 Very aggressive.

59
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,560
 And that aggressiveness will cause me 31 seconds on the clock.

60
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,240
 Knight f6.

61
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,640
 Well at least since he moved his queen to the middle of the board, he should have already

62
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,560
 calculated where to move his queen next, knowing that it will be attacked immediately.

63
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,160
 Or not.

64
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,960
 Queen g5.

65
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,000
 22.3 seconds.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,520
 Man, I should have known that I cannot attack 100 rated queens, since they will use a lot

67
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,560
 of time to think about where to move it.

68
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
 a6.

69
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,960
 Alright, it's still fine.

70
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,520
 We still have 31 seconds left, so as long as he can make quick moves, there are still

71
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,520
 hopes.

72
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,640
 16.4 seconds.

73
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,240
 We're having 31 seconds on the clock, and this guy said.

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,400
 You need 32 seconds for your next move.

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,680
 What the f-

76
00:04:50,680 --> 00:05:05,320
