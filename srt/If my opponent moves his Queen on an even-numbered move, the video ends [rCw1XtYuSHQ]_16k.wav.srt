1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 If my opponent moves his queen on an even-numbered move,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 the video ends.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Playing 3-minute splits on a 100-rated account.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Okay. Even numbers suck.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Let's find an opponent.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 We get a 1 0 8 from the U.S.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 E4

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 E5

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Still theory.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 For those of you who don't know how the moves are numbered,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 they are written right here.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Also, in this game, my opponent is playing black,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 so his moves will be noted on the right-hand side.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And with that out of the way, let's continue the game.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 The next move is an even-numbered move,

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 therefore, queen E7, queen F6, queen G5, and queen H4

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 are all threats to the video.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 But sadly, there's no way I can prevent all of them from happening.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 So I guess, knight F3.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 At least I can stop two of them, right?

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Bishop C5.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Thank you.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Even though the next move is not even-numbered,

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I still think I need to work my way up to control more dangerous squares.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Therefore, D4.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 E takes D4.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 E5.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Now my E-pawn takes away the F6 square from his queen too,

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 and since queen E7 is such an absurd move to play,

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 I can say that this video is going to last really long.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 D3.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 That blunders a pawn.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 H5.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Very aggressive.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 But actually, I think that's pretty good for me.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Castle.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Since I have castled king side,

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 he now has even more reasons to push his pawn towards my king,

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 instead of moving his queen.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Right?

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 What the f-
