1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 100 rated chess, but you have a rook lift every 3 moves.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,480
 Very salty.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,120
 We get a 198 from Russia.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,800
 E4.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,600
 Since I'll have to lift a rook on move 3.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,760
 H5 is kinda forced.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,760
 Bishop E2.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,280
 Very aggressive.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,120
 Just as I pushed my pawn, he immediately attacked it.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
 Therefore.

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,540
 H4.

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:32,920
 You know what people say, if you can't protect your girl, just put her in more danger.

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,400
 H3.

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,240
 Not very aggressive.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,920
 The time has come.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,680
 Rook H7 is kinda forced.

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,680
 G3.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,800
 I'll take it.

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,760
 Opening up more room for my rook to move is always good.

20
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,760
 F takes.

21
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,160
 This rook doesn't have many squares left to move, and I don't really want to pull it back

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,880
 to just push it again in the future.

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,240
 Therefore, A5.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,360
 Man, this challenge is getting a little bit annoying.

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,520
 A4.

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,080
 Very aggressive.

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,080
 Rook A7 is kinda forced.

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,720
 Knight C3.

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,960
 Ha!

30
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,960
 Finally!

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,400
 After all of those moves, now I finally have some time to develop the other pieces.

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,960
 E5.

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,640
 Taking the center baby.

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,480
 Bishop H5.

35
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,860
 Well.

36
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,920
 That is very aggressive, but I really don't understand the purpose of that move.

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,600
 Bishop C5.

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
 Queen F3.

39
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,080
 Oh wow!

40
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:44,880
 So Bishop H5 is to attack the F7 pawn with the future queen on F3.

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,940
 Dude, the creativity is absolutely remarkable.

42
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,940
 But anyway.

43
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,740
 I have to lift a rook now, but a normal rook lift is just hanging my king.

44
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,380
 Therefore, rook takes H5 is forced.

45
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,860
 Man, this guy has to be the creativest guy I have ever seen.

46
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,780
 Queen takes H5.

47
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,860
 It's fine, I still have another rook here.

48
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,900
 Queen F6.

49
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:16,540
 I mean since he tried to checkmate me, how about we try to checkmate him back.

50
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,020
 Ha!

51
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,340
 Noob!

52
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,620
 That blunders a king.

53
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,780
 Queen F2 check.

54
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,500
 King D1 is forced.

55
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,620
 Oh, wait.

56
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,700
 Even though queen F1 is checkmate in 1, it's actually a third move.

57
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,220
 Therefore, rook K6 is forced.

58
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,580
 This challenge is going very wrong very quickly.

59
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,580
 He takes my knight.

60
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,580
 King E7.

61
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,660
 Ok dude, now just take my bishop and we can continue to checkmate your king.

62
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,740
 Well.

63
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,540
 That also works.

64
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,420
 Queen to F1.

65
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,420
 Checkmate.

66
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,180
 Mission accomplished.

67
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:14,100
