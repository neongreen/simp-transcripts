00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 If something attacks a knight, simp explains how the knight actually goes.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,520
 Fine. This is obviously a very hard challenge, but I actually believe, that I can make a long

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:20,640
 video with it. We get a 2 41 from France. My most usual first move is e4, but in this game, e4 opens

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,360
 up my queen, and later on in the game, there may be knight f6 and knight g4, which makes my queen

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:40,240
 attacks his knight, which ends the video. Therefore, d4. d5. Bishop f4. e5. Very aggressive. That blunders

6
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,560
 a pawn. And that was very good, because now he can't develop his knight to f6 anymore, and if he

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:54,560
 can't develop his knight to the center, it will less likely be attacked by my pieces. c6. e3.

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,280
 f5. Ah ha, now en passant is possible, but since it only provokes knight f6, which is not good for

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,800
 the video, so I guess we'll have to skip the French move this time. Bishop d3. I can already see,

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,800
 that some people are gonna say, I can't believe you didn't play en passant disliked unsubbed.

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:24,960
 But you know, I only play for the video's sake. Knight d7. That blunders a pawn, but of course,

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:33,280
 that attacks his knight on d7, which makes me a fool, for ending my own video. So I guess. a4.

13
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,560
 Of course I don't want to develop my knights at any cost, so I need to make room to move my rook

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:52,400
 out in the future. Bishop c5. h4. h5. Very aggressive. Rook h3. g6. Rook g3. Actually,

15
00:01:52,400 --> 00:02:00,880
 I think my moves are even more aggressive than his. Knight e7. Wow, just look at his knight,

16
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:08,880
 there is absolutely nowhere to go to. But anyway. Queen f3. I mean I'm pretty much out of moves,

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:17,760
 so it was just a random one. Queen a5 check. Very aggressive. c3 is obviously the best move,

18
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,280
 but let's go with. King f1. I mean I can't castle anyway, so it's a good chance to hide my king away

19
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:35,120
 from the center. Rook g8. Ha! A moment ago, this knight still had the g8 square. But now,

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:46,400
 it's officially trapped. c3. b5. That blunders a bishop. Oh, wait. Now if he goes bishop takes b4,

21
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,720
 I won't be able to take back, because if c takes b4, there is queen takes b4 attacking my knight.

22
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:04,960
 My bad. Nevermind. B takes c5. Queen takes c5. A takes b5. And in no world do you take with your

23
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:18,880
 queen here. Of course. Rook a5. a6. Not very aggressive. c4. Man, this video is lasting much

24
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:27,040
 longer than I expected. B takes c4. That blunders a queen. But should I even take it, though?

25
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,920
 Because if I take his queen, knight takes will bring his knight closer to the center,

26
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:40,320
 which may turn the video down very quickly. You know what? I think it's fine. Rook takes c5.

27
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:51,280
 Knight takes c5. Bishop takes c4. Oh, wait. I blundered knight e4. But I didn't blunder that one.

28
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:59,760
 Okay fine, I'll explain how the knights really move. You see, a lot of people just don't want

29
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,640
 to talk about this stuff when they get asked, and just say simple stuff like,

30
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,760
 they move in the L shape. But in fact, that is not true. To make it easier to understand,

31
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,840
 let's imagine, that you are driving a car to the supermarket. And now that you have arrived,

32
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,800
 you need to turn your car in a direction, so you can park it in the correct parking lot.

33
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,640
 Knights are no different. A knight is a combination of a guy riding a horse. And when that guy needs

34
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,120
 to go to a square on the chessboard, he rides his horse there, and then takes a turn to park

35
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,520
 his horse on the very next square. And there you have it, that is the undeniable fact about how

36
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:59,520
 the knights move.
