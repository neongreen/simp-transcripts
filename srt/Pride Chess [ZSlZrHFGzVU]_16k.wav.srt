 100 rated chess. But it's Pride Month, all of your pieces, not pawns, must not move straight.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,440
 It's very weird that the only individuals on the board that can change gender are the only things

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,080
 that don't take part in the challenge. But who cares anyway. We get a 132 from Cambodia.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:32,960
 E4. Again, pawns are not included. D5. I'll take it. Queen takes. Knight C3. A knight definitely

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:41,520
 doesn't move straight. Queen E5. Bishop E2. I mean even though diagonals are actually straight lines,

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,960
 we all know very clear that the challenge giver did not include them.

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:01:00,080
 H5. Very aggressive. Knight F3. Queen E6. D4. Bishop D7. Bishop F4. At this point,

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:11,760
 I dare to say that I'm 100% going to win this super easy challenge. B5. D5. Queen A6. A4.

9
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,200
 I mean this move is actually not that good because my rook is totally exempted from this

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:26,320
 game due to the rules, but maybe this guy is an unpaid actor. Thank you. That blunders a woman.

11
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:35,520
 Knight takes A6. I actually cannot castle. So queen E2. This queen is just a bishop in disguise.

12
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:47,440
 Rook B8. Very aggressive. But that blunders a horsey. Rook takes B2. Ah ha. Knight takes A4.

13
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:55,280
 Please take this knight and blunder your king. Or not. Knight E5. I know you want it.

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,840
 Dude. I actually believe that this guy sees the checkmate threat.

15
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,120
 Knight C5. Before you jump down to the comment section and type "Trash YouTuber you blundered

16
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,440
 your horsey disliked unsubbed", I just want to say that Stockfish thinks this move is excellent.

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,960
 And yes I did blunder my horsey that does happen sometimes.

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:30,800
 E6. Ha. That blocks the bishop. Queen C8 check. King E7 is forced. Now there is queen C7 king E8

19
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:38,480
 queen D7 checkmate in two. But my queen is just a bishop. So bishop G5 check. No disrespect,

20
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:48,320
 but I don't think he has the gut to go king D6. Yeah. No disrespect. Queen D7. Checkmate.

21
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,680
 Mission. Accomplished.

22
00:02:51,680 --> 00:03:05,760
