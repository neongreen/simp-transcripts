1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 If my opponent can blunder a piece, not a pawn.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 The video ends.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Also, I cannot make any sacrifices.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Because you know, if I can just sacrifice my pieces whenever I can, this video is going to be too long to edit.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Okay, it's pretty obvious that I'm out of ideas, so I have to take on this absurdly hard challenge.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 But no worries, I think after all of those videos, I have built myself enough experience, to tackle any challenges thrown at me.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Therefore, let's find an opponent.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 We get a 108 from Peru.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 So I think the challenge wants me to give my opponent absolutely no chance to blunder, no matter how hard he tries.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Therefore, playing in the center, may just be too risky.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I mean just take a look at E4.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 If I play E4, he may decide to go knight F6, which allows the move knight D5, blundering a knight.

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 And since there's no way I can prevent knight D5, the video is going to end after move 1.

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 So I guess, I need to get away from the center, as far as possible.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 A4.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 C5.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Well, that's good.

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I was expecting E5, with a threat of bishop A3 ending the video, but this move C5, comes with no threat at all.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 H4.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Man, I think all I can do, is just to extend this video as long as possible, because I cannot see any ways to make progress.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Knight C6.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Still no threats yet.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 G3.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 B6.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Ah ha! He's obviously baiting me to play bishop G2, which pins his knight to his rook, but then also gives him a chance to blunder his rook by moving his knight away, which then makes me a fool, for ending my own video.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Therefore, B3.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 A6.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I want to play bishop B2. But of course, there is G6 after that, which blunders his rook.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Therefore, bishop H3.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Bishop H7.

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Bishop A3.

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I'll be honest, this video is lasting longer than I thought it would.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Queen B8.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Ah ha! Now things are kicking in. There is obviously a threat of queen G3, blundering a queen on his next move, and as far as I can see, there is no way to prevent that from happening.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And since we cannot prevent a blunder threat, let's turn that blunder, into a best move.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 F3.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Now queen takes G3 is no longer a blunder, but a best move. And after queen takes G3 check, king F1 is the last move of the video, because he will have too many chances to blunder his queen.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 But still, there is still hope, that he doesn't see the move.

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Yes! Not only he didn't see the move, but he also blocked away his queen's view towards my G-pawn.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 But now, it's my move. I think moving my bishop back and forth is the best way to keep the video survive, but of course, if I do that, people will say that I'm a coward in the comments section.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Therefore, let's play a bit more risky. Knight C3.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Knight G E7.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 Man! This guy made me instantly regret playing knight C3. Because now he has 2 threats of blundering, knight D5, or knight F5.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Bishop takes D7 check, sacrificing the bishop to eliminate 1 threat is obviously my best choice. But sadly, that's against the rules.

46
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Ok. I guess, it's time to admit my defeat.

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And since this video ends at my move, there is no what the f*ck today.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Thanks for watching!
