00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,360
 100 rated chess, but your king is in his prime, on every prime numbered move, you must move

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,600
 your king, and on every non-prime numbered move, you must not move your king.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,040
 I mean if my king is in his prime, I am in my prime as well.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,780
 We get a 185 from Brazil.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,080
 In case you don't know what a prime number is, a prime number is a whole number greater

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,020
 than one that can only be exactly divided by one and itself.

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,160
 And I'm not going to explain what dividing is.

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,160
 E4.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,560
 I need to make room for my king to move, but if I play E5, Qh5 will be very dangerous,

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,600
 because I'll have to make a king move on move 2, which may result in Qe5 checkmate

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,800
 in 1.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,480
 Therefore, E6 is kinda forced.

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,260
 Ha!

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,880
 You see, E5 would've been a very humiliating disaster.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,120
 King E7 is forced.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
 D3.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,480
 3 is also a prime number, and even though I can advance my king forward, that is way

18
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,080
 too dank.

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,080
 D4.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,640
 I guess D3 was a mouse slip.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,440
 I'll have to make a king move on move 5, so Bg5 will be very dangerous to both my king

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,480
 and my queen, Be7.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,920
 Knight C3.

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,640
 King F8 is forced.

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,480
 Knight B5.

26
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,960
 Very aggressive.

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,000
 If he takes this pawn on move 7, I move my king and I'll lose my rook.

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,840
 Therefore, I'll force him to move his queen.

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,200
 And in no world do you push this pawn and then I have to move my king and then you win

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,560
 my horsey for free.

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,840
 I'm worrying too much.

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,120
 King move.

33
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,480
 Bishop G5.

34
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,040
 Alright, now I'll have some continuous moves in a row.

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,540
 Knight C6.

36
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,500
 If I can win his queen during these moves, maybe I'll get an early resignation before

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,440
 everything is too late.

38
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
 Queen F4.

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,440
 A6.

40
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,560
 I mean a horsey is also fine.

41
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,000
 Thank you.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,920
 A takes B5.

43
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,680
 And let's just hope he won't attack anything now because I'll have to move my king next.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,020
 There we go.

45
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,680
 King F8 is forced.

46
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,680
 Ha!

47
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,560
 Now what can go wrong anyway?

48
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,920
 I take that back.

49
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,840
 That blunders a horsey, but I cannot move my king on a non-prime move.

50
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,280
 Queen E8 is kinda forced.

51
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,520
 The plan was to force a quick resignation, but now it is going very wrong very quickly.

52
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,480
 My rook is dead.

53
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,800
 King G8 is forced.

54
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,800
 And funny enough, even if he leaves his knight right there, I still won't be able to capture

55
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:00,380
 it all the way until move 17, but in this position, something unexpected happened.

56
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,400
 My opponent disconnected.

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:10,240
 11, 10, 9, 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0.

58
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,280
 Mission accomplished.

59
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:26,120
