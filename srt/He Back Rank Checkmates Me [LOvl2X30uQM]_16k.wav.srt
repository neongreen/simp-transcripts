1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 100 rated chess, but you can only capture one piece, or pawn, every 10 moves.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,400
 Ha, in case you don't know, I have managed to defeat a lot of people without capturing any

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,360
 pieces at all while also trying to do another challenge in the meantime, so this one should

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:25,280
 be a walk in the park. We get a 187 from Australia. E4. I guess some people may say that I should have

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,840
 played E4 instead of E4 to go for a more positional opening and avoid too many tactics and captures,

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:41,680
 but sadly, I'm not a coward. E5. Knight F3. Knight F6. Normally I would have taken this pawn

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,960
 without thinking, but classical Petrov defense requires a lot of captures and tactics, which is

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:54,400
 definitely not good for this video, so I guess, Knight C3. Again, I'm not a coward, I'm just trying

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:03,200
 my best to extend the video's length. Knight C6. Four knights game. Bishop C4. Man I hate this

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:12,240
 boring opening. Bishop C5. Still theory by the way. And you know what? I'll stop the theory here.

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,960
 Threatening an attack at his F-hawn, and even though he's been playing like he wants to castle

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:25,840
 kingside, I doubt that a 170 rated player knows anything about that room. Exactly. That blunders

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,480
 a horsey. With that knight's death, now I can not capture anything until move number 16, so in no

14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:42,000
 world do you take this knight here. Rook G8. Ha! I bet you he tried to castle. So of course. Castle.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,280
 Showing him how the professionals do it. Knight B4. Bishop B3. Queen F6. My god that looks like

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:59,200
 a mouse lip. D3. No need to rush, I cannot capture anything until move 16, so we should just slowly

17
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:07,200
 make progress here. Nevermind. That blunders a bishop, but king H1 is forced. I can already see,

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:15,440
 that this video is not going to last for much longer. Bishop D4. Aha! That blunders a queen,

19
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,480
 but in fact, it is him who's trying to backrank checkmate me, so I guess. Bishop D2. In no world

20
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:35,040
 do you...

21
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:47,280
 ...do that.
