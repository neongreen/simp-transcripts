 100 rated chess, but if your opponent's clock is an even number after his turn,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,320
 then you can only move to even ranks, the same thing also applies with odd number.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,760
 Too easy.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:21,920
 E3. 4 minute 54 seconds, which is an even number. Therefore, G6, unlike yesterday when I had to rely

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,560
 on the RNG god, today's RNG is totally depending on my opponent.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,480
 Knight F3. Odd number. D5. G3. Even number. Bishop G4. Ha, now if he can just move the

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,120
 knight away and stop the clock on an odd number time to allow bishop takes D1,

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,200
 that will be extremely convenient.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:54,000
 Well, I guess sometimes convenient things do happen in our lives. Bishop takes D1.

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,480
 King takes, odd move again, E5. One more odd move please.

11
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:10,880
 Even move. It's fine. D4. E takes D4. Even move again, but again, it is still fine,

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,400
 statistically speaking, next move should be an odd move.

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,840
 Nevermind. Knight C6, I can see that the RNG stuff is starting to turn its ass against me.

14
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,720
 Bishop G2. The 4th even move in a row, and you know what, I'll just go queen F6. I'm forking

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,520
 2 things, 1 in an odd rank, 1 in an even rank, and as long as he doesn't see knight F3, I should be

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:46,080
 able to take something next. After this check, king D8 is kinda forced. Knight takes F7 check.

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,640
 Wow. That blunders a horsey, but since the clock is at an even number, king C8 is forced.

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,160
 Now don't tell me that he's gonna go bishop H3 forces king B8 and then rook E8 check on an

19
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:06,880
 odd number time which ends the video because I have no legal odd rank moves. Thank you.

20
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,280
 King D7 is forced, but still, this guy is totally destroying me with his random.

21
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:24,320
 Nevermind. King takes E8. Knight takes H8. Ah ha, after all those crazy moves,

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:31,280
 I finally have a chance to attack. King E1 is forced, queen H1 looks very tempting,

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,280
 but as everyone can see the very obvious checkmate in 3 in this position, it has to be D3.

24
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:47,760
 Knight takes G6. Queen E2. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:03:00,160
