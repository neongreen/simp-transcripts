00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 100 rated chess. But I have to predict my opponent's move.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 I have two predictions.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Dude. I mean, two is too few. I'll make it. Four.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And don't you dare say that I'm a coward in the comments section.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Anyway, the reason I'm playing chess against 100 rated players, is because we can never predict what is going to happen.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 And then there comes this guy, who wants me, to do the opposite thing.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 There's no way this video can last over 3 minutes.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 But anyway, let's find an opponent.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 We get a 180 from the US.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Okay. You know what? I'm not going to guess the first move.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Because let's be real here, how am I supposed to know which opening he's playing, right?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 E. E4.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Once again, I'm passing on the first move.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And once again, I'm not a coward.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 G6.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Ha! You see? If I was guessing the first move, there's no way I would pick G6 as one of my choices.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 D4.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Since he played G6 first, I think he's some sort of a King's Indian player.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Therefore, I'm guessing, Bg7, D6, Nf6, or Nc6.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Nf6.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Yes.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 E? No. That is a bit too risky.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Because if I play E5, he will most likely be going to move his knight again,

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 and since there are 4 safe squares for his knight,

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'll have to take all of those 4 guesses, which may lead to a failed mission, if he blunders it instead.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 So I guess, Nc3.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 I'm guessing, Bg7, Nc6, D6, or even E6.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Nc6.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Yes.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Now D5 looks really good, because it forces knight back to B8, or if knight B4, A3, Na6, and his knight is on the rim.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 But of course, there is no way I can know, whether he's going to blunder knight E5 or not,

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 and if I'm taking guesses, I don't want to waste my chances on a move, that is a blunder.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 So I guess, Nf3.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I'm guessing, Bg7, D6, E6, or B6.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And dude, there is no way this move is a failure, because there is literally nothing else that he can do.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 E6.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Yeah, that's not a good move, but it's still in my radar.

39
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Bg5.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I'm about to go E5 next, therefore, I'm guessing, Be7, or H6,

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 because he should be able to see, that all the other choices, are simply blundering a piece.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 The other 2 choices are maybe, D6, and Bg7.

43
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Those are bad, but you know, I need to maximize my chances.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
