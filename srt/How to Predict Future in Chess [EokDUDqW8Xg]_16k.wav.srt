 100 rated chess, but the amount of reactions in this message is the amount of pre-moves you have

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:15,600
 to make. 9? Is not that many. First move is obviously the best time to make a pre-move. E5.

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:26,960
 Pre-move successfully. D4. I'll take that pawn. It's pretty obvious that his queen will recapture.

4
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:33,920
 Knight C6 pre-move. And even if he doesn't recapture, knight C6 is still a very good

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:44,560
 developing move. Exactly as planned. Queen E4 check. Bishop blocks. Knight F6 pre-move,

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,960
 and in no world do you take my bishop here with a check and ruin my pre-move.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:01,680
 Of course. Queen F3. Knight D4. Knight takes F6 check is a threat, but of course he doesn't

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,120
 want me to put my bishop on a more active square, so of course he won't be doing that,

9
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:14,640
 and I expect he'll be going queen E3 blundering his queen, knight takes E2 pre-move. Very risky,

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:24,080
 but I'm down to sacrifice a horsey for the greater good. Well? I mean the pre-move worked,

11
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:32,080
 but didn't as I expected. Ha! Nevermind, it worked as I expected. Knight E4 knight G3.

12
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:42,800
 Free woman. Castle. It's pretty concerning that he may decide to resign too early as I have

13
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:51,200
 already taken his queen halfway into the challenge. Doesn't count, 9 is too many,

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,600
 and there is no way a 100 rated guy can last 20 moves against me, so mission accomplished,

15
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,400
 and I'll answer some comments. I expected the rushy song to be played. There is a thing called

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:13,600
 copy strike. This video is too short, answer some comments instead. No? You are wrong.

17
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:22,160
 This video is too short, so I'm answering some comments instead. Assuming pawns are female is

18
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,240
 different from assuming females are pawns, besides in the rushy isles, the monarch is called king

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:35,120
 even if they are female, so who knows, maybe queens are male. I actually have a video about

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:46,000
 queen David, but I don't remember which one, so yeah, queens can be male.
