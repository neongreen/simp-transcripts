00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
 100 rated chess, but you resign when you have mate in 1. A loss, is a win. We get a 1 53 from India.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:17,120
 e4, f5, the renowned Duras gambit. Which is a bad opening.

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:31,920
 He takes f5. Queen h5 is very dangerous. Knight f6. Queen e2. d5. Knight c3. I'll take this pawn

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,520
 back. The only way I can win this challenge is to create a very difficult to see checkmate in

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,880
 1 that my opponent fails to see and I also need to keep my opponent from resigning the game.

6
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:54,320
 That blunders a horsey. It's fine, I mean who resigns just because of a horsey. Right?

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:05,200
 Of course. Queen a5. Knight f3 knight c6. Enough material developed, now I only need to find a way

8
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:14,160
 to set up a tricky checkmate. Knight h4. My bishop should be used to control his king, bishop c2.

9
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,120
 Queen d3. That blunders a queen, but I definitely don't want to take it because

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,440
 it only provokes a resignation. And my bishop is trapped.

11
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:34,400
 What kind of situation that a queen gets to trap a bishop by staying on a same color square.

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,400
 And on the same f***ing diagonal. And he offered a draw. The challenge requires me to resign,

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,680
 so of course I cannot accept this. Knight b5.

14
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:54,640
 What the f***

15
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:06,880
 is
