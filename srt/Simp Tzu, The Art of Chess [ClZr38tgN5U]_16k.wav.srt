00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 100 rated chess, but you need to justify your moves by the quotes from Sun Tzu's Art of War.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,240
 Well I mean doing this in every move sounds a little bit too hard, so let's just say,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,000
 that I'll do it every 3 moves. Let's go. So the very first chapter of the book can be

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,840
 summarized in one sentence as, "Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak."

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,040
 Therefore, A3. A3 is a very bad opening move, but since everyone knows that I'm a stronger

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,160
 chess player than my opponent, therefore I need to appear weak in my first opening move.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:47,760
 E5. E4. That's not a Sun Tzu's move, I'll do it on move 4. Queen H4. Very aggressive. Knight C3.

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:55,120
 Bishop C5. Aha, what a perfect chance for a high level tactic Sun Tzu's move.

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,640
 Knight H3. Even though the grandmasters always say, that knight on the rim is dim, Sun Tzu actually

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,400
 has a different idea in his books. He said, "If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,800
 your enemies will float by." Which can be translated to chess, as, "If your horsey waits by the rim of

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,760
 the board long enough, your enemy will blunder their queen when they move her by." Maybe not yet.

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,440
 I really want to push G3 to attack his queen, but if he doesn't blunder the woman, people will have

14
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,280
 their chance to say that Sun Tzu was wrong, which is going to be a total disrespect to a military

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:42,320
 artist. So I guess, Bishop C4. Knight C6. D3. High level tactic coming up next.

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:51,440
 F5. Okay, it is time for my number one favorite quote in the book. It reads as, "The supreme art

17
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,440
 of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting." Therefore, can you please resign?

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,320
 Well, I guess that's a no. I'll take this pawn. Queen takes F2 check. That blunders a woman.

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:18,000
 And then he said no. Knight D4. Now I'm pretty sure that he's resigning very soon because it

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,960
 feels like he's really regretting that queen blunder, so I guess every move from now on

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,440
 should be a Sun Tzu's move. Let's go for this one. Victorious warriors win first and then go to war,

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,960
 while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win. No? Wait. I actually don't

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,760
 understand this one. Okay, let's change it to, "To know your enemy, you must become your enemy."

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,000
 And to be honest, I also don't understand this one either.

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,840
 Alright, who cares. I'll take this pawn. And resignation. Mission accomplished.

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:10,560
