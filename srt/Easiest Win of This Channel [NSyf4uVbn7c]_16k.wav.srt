 100 rated chess, but you can only capture pieces which worth more or equal points with the piece

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,320
 you captured before it. I think I've done something similar to this before, but since I don't remember

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:20,880
 it, I guess it's fine to take it on again. We get a 144 from his rail. E4. The plan is very simple.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,920
 We take all the pawns first, and then all the minor pieces, and then all the rooks, and then

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,480
 the woman, and it ends right there because taking the king is not an option. And he decided to give

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:42,320
 me a pawn capture to start the game. He takes D5. Knight C6. Ah ha. That blunders a horsey, but if I

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,960
 take that horsey now, I won't be able to take any pawns from that point onward. So I guess, I'm not

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,560
 gonna do that. It's fine, it's not like he's not gonna blunder anything from now on anyway. G5.

9
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:06,560
 Very aggressive. D3. E6. Ah ha. I can take this pawn. A lot of people may protest against this

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:15,040
 move as it loses a horsey, but I don't give a sh*t. Rook B8. A very useful move. I'll take this pawn

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,720
 too. You know what, maybe this game is gonna become the easiest win in this entire channel.

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:33,440
 King takes F7. Queen H5 check. King E7. Bishop takes another pawn. King E6. Okay. Here comes the

13
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,680
 question. Do I take this queen? I mean if I take his queen, I will be banned from capturing anything

14
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,560
 from that point onward, which will give him the chance to go absolutely crazy and destroy my

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,080
 entire territory. But the good thing is, he may resign immediately after becoming maidenless.

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:59,600
 Well, as always, I'm not a coward. Who knows, maybe he'll decide not to capture my bishop

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,480
 and blunder queen D5 checkmate in one in the middle of the board. Man, I should have hired

18
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:14,240
 a paid actor for this recording so that he could have done better. But anyway. Queen D5. Checkmate.

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,800
 Mission accomplished.
