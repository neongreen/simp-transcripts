 100 rated chess, but you have to move your piece. Not pawn. 3 times before moving another one.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:20,320
 Not pawn. That sounds very 100 rated. We get a 2 26 from Italy. E4. E5, and since he's an Italian,

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:30,720
 we can obviously expect knight f3 bishop c4. Or not. Knight c6. Alright, it's game on. Now I'm

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,040
 stuck with this knight for at least 2 more moves, so if he goes crazy and play queen f7 right now,

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,320
 it forces me to take with my king, which is against the rules, which makes me a fool,

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:50,800
 for ending my own video. Of course it doesn't happen. G6. I think we can all agree that this

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:59,680
 move is not against the rule because it only applies to pieces, not pawns. Queen h3. D6. Of

8
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,120
 course I cannot take his queen because I'm still stuck with my knight for 2 more moves. But you

9
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:14,320
 know, he doesn't know about that. Or maybe he does. Knight c7. I'm trying to exhaust my knight

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:24,400
 moves here. D4. Knight c6. Alright, now you'd better move your queen away. Or not. And I've

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,160
 just realized that if I take his queen, that will make me move my bishop 1 time, which means I'll

12
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,440
 have to move it at least 2 more times, but if he takes the bishop, I won't be able to make those

13
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:43,360
 2 moves anymore, which means I can never move any pieces ever again. Well, I guess I can't eat that

14
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:53,520
 woman just yet. He takes d4. Knight g5. Very aggressive. Now knight h6 does protect the f7

15
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,760
 pawn, but it makes the knight stuck on h6 to defend the pawn, which means I won't be able to move it

16
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:07,920
 2 times more anytime soon. Therefore, knight e5. This is my 4th knight move, but since the challenge

17
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,560
 said, at least, I believe that I don't have to move it for 2 more times, because you know, 4 is

18
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:23,680
 not less than 3. Queen g3. Ha, now he finally sees the queen is hanging. But that still blunders the

19
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:36,400
 bishop. Queen d3. Knight e5. Queen takes d4. Ha ha, finally, I can move another piece. Bishop g7.

20
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:47,120
 Ah, that feels good. Queen d5. Very aggressive. And wait, I think he's thinking that queen takes

21
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,360
 f7 is mate, which blunders a queen, but the point is I'm being stuck with my bishop, which means I

22
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:01,680
 cannot move my knight. So that queen move will force me to end my own video. Man. This is really

23
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:10,880
 bad. Alright. Bishop h6. Let's just hope that he gets panicked seeing his knight being attacked

24
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:21,040
 by 2 pieces and then retreat it. F***. You know what? I'm just gonna end the video right here,

25
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,640
 because there is no need to make that move to humiliate myself.
