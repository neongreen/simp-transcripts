1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 We meet again, Black King.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Why do I always have to see you?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Who else do you expect to see here?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 I don't know. Candice?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Who's Candice?

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Candice NU-

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 You asked for it. Now I unleash my hidden weapon.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 This pawn go. I'll tell you what to do.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Now you should push your center pawn to open up your bishop's way of attacking my newly pushed pawn.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Yeah sure.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Wrong pawn you idiot.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Now move the other one.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Oh how dare you copied my move. I'll copy your move back.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Who's copying who now you moron?

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 You messed up my entire opening preparation.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 D3.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Oh now you dare attacking my pawn.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 You know what? How about I let you attack another pawn.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Which pawn are you going to take now you mother-

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 What an idiot. I'll just take one of those.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 If you are given two women to pick, just randomly pick one of them you overthinker.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Oh is that so? How about I give you three choices.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Oh no. What do I do now? No one taught me how to handle this overwhelming situation.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Random capture.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Ha. Wrong move. That let me move my queen.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 PFFT. Moving your woman? Now move her again.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 You dare challenging me to move my woman again? I will do so.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 I push this pawn. Now don't take it and let me fork you.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 In your dream. Ha. Watch and learn you noob. This is called a double attack,

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 which means I'm having two completely separate attacks at your pieces.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 And now you can only save one of those two things, which means I'll get something for free.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Ha. Watch and learn you noob. Just move a piece to protect the other one.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Your elementary tactic doesn't work.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Ha. I also calculated that. Your horsey is blocking your woman, so I win this soldier.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 So what? I'll let this soldier avenge his dead comrade.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So what? I can move it here. Tick.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Wait what tick? What do you say when you attack your opponent's king?

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I check. Then what do you say when you attack your opponent's queen?

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 We don't have a word for that. And for the gender equality purpose,

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 I suggest we call that tick from now on.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Okay so you want to tick my queen. I'll move her then.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Some nice battery you have there. Now I want take your bishop.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 You want take my bishop, I don't want you take my bishop.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 You don't want me take your bishop, I want you take my bishop.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 You want me take your bishop, I don't take your bishop.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 You can leave your bishop there and I promise to never ever touch it.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 You want me leave my bishop, I move my bishop.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 That blunders a woman.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I thought we were talking about bishops.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Who cares about dudes.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 You want me take your bishop, I don't take your bishop.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 You want me take your bishop, I take your pawn.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 I want you take my bishop, you take my pawn, my pawn takes your bishop.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I want you take my bishop, your pawn takes my bishop,

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 my bishop can take your knight, but I'll do it with woman.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Dude I don't have my woman anymore.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 That is not my problem.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Oh you dare attack my rook? I will let you do so.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 And I will do so.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Ha! It is time for me to deliver my ultimate tactic.

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 King d7.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 I warn you, you better retreat your queen before managing to blunder her in my territory.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Ha! It's like you can touch my woman.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 I'll take this pawn.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Maybe I blundered my woman, but I will never blunder my animals.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Check.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 So what?

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 So what?

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 So what?

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So I move my king.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Since I don't have much time left, I resign.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And technically speaking, you still haven't won the game yet.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And technically speaking, you still haven't won the game yet.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:04,000
