00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 100 rated chess, but there are self-defense laws, you can only take a piece, or pawn,

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,840
 that is attacking one of your pieces, or pawns. I personally don't know what a self-defense law is,

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,760
 but of course, I only need to care about the challenge, we get a 1 0 3 from the Netherlands.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:33,440
 E4. E5. Still theory. No more theory. D5. Bishop B5 check. Very aggressive. C6. Bishop A4.

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:44,240
 Ok here we go. This pawn is obviously attacking my pawn, therefore, I can take it. D4. Aha. Again,

6
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:52,240
 this pawn is also attacking my pawn, so once again, I can take it. Knight H3 queen A5 bishop D2.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,480
 This bishop is actually attacking my pawn here, so of course, I can take it. Man,

8
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:07,840
 this is actually even more easy than I expected. A3. Knight F6. B3. I'll pull my woman back.

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,640
 A4. Aha. That is blundering a pawn, but sadly, that pawn is not attacking anything from my army,

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:25,920
 which means I cannot take that pawn. H5. B4. Aha, now this pawn is attacking my pawn,

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,320
 therefore, I can take it. So as you can see, my bishop is attacking his queen, but his queen is

12
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,000
 actually also attacking my bishop, so if he can just blunder his queen right now, that will be

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,160
 very convenient. I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. I'll take the woman.

14
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:56,160
 King takes, ok, let me prove it to you, that he's not a paid actor. B3. A paid actor would

15
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,280
 take my pawn and absolutely blunder their rook, which means that this guy will not be making that

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:12,560
 move. No, this doesn't count. Queen takes A1. B takes A7. That blunders a horsey, but since it's

17
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,560
 not attacking anything, I cannot take it, and even though I should really take this pawn, let's go

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:27,200
 for, bishop E7. Ok. Now comes the hard truth. If he was really a paid actor, he would not take my

19
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:36,000
 knight and change Andy's gender. There we go, now we all know he's not a paid actor. Rook takes new

20
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,920
 woman B5. Rook takes bishop G5. That blunders rook B1. King E2. Queen A6. C4. Queen A2. Bishop D2.

21
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,360
 Queen C4. Checkmate in 4, but sadly that is against the rules so queen B2. King D2. D3. Knight C3.

22
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,640
 Ah ha, so it seems like this pawn is attacking my pawn so I can take it, but actually, this pawn

23
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,680
 is pinned to his king, which means it cannot move, so it's actually not attacking anything. Rook C5.

24
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:13,760
 Knight takes E4. I can take that king D3. Bishop G5. King E4. Queen E5. King D3. Rook C3. Checkmate.

25
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:22,080
 Mission accomplished.

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,660
 (upbeat music)

27
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,240
 (upbeat music)

28
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,820
 (upbeat music)

29
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,500
 (upbeat music)
