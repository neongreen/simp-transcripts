00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
 If someone moves a bishop, simp draws an elephant.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,080
 Okay so for anyone who doesn't know, the bishops are actually called elephants in Chinese chess.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,560
 And those pieces suck.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,120
 But anyway. We get a 2-94 from Uruguay.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,200
 Pushing a center pawn doesn't seem to be a great idea,

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,240
 since it mostly provokes my opponent to do the same, which opens up his bishop's way.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,680
 Therefore, c4. I'm pretty sure he's just gonna play c5 and leave his bishops closed.

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,960
 E6.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,960
 Alright. It's fine. Now the threats are bishop c5 and bishop b4,

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,440
 because the other 2 moves look pretty stupid.

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,960
 Therefore, a3. That will at least stop bishop b4.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,720
 And he should be able to see, that bishop c5 will immediately get kicked back by b4.

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,680
 And not to mention that a lot of people just push their e-pawn to develop their queen.

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,040
 Ha! I called it.

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,800
 b4. Now bishop c5 is no longer a threat anymore, and since the other 2 moves are bad,

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,920
 this entire bishop is basically no longer a threat.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:24,880
 f5. Wow! That is even better for me, since this bishop is basically crying from his home.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,640
 Nf3. It would be great if he can take this pawn instead of just retreating,

19
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,760
 but horizontal moves tend to be a little bit hard to see.

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,720
 Qg4. Ah ha! I guess we are a bit closer to our goal now.

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
 h3.

22
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
 Finally!

23
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,920
 d3. The more you move your queen, the longer the video gets.

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,720
 Ha! That is interesting.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,040
 Should I sacrifice my rook to keep him moving his queen,

26
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 or should I just take his queen and risk the chance of him moving his bishop?

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,600
 I'll take his queen. I mean that rook is innocent, and just look at this bishop.

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,800
 No way out, and this bishop just doesn't have any moves that make sense,

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,040
 so it's also kinda no way out.

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,880
 Yeah I should have sacrificed my rook.

31
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,520
 And you know what the worst part is?

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,200
 Bishop e7 is excellent.

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:49,280
 Yeah I think that's good enough.

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:03:04,320
