00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 If someone loses the right to castle, Simp draws an Italian castle.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Okay sure. We get a 180 from the US.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 E4. Ah ha, now King E2 loses the right to castle.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 But of course, there's nothing I can do about it, and it's not very likely that he's going to play that move anyway.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 E5. Let's just hope that he's not Hikaru Nakamura.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Yeah he's not. Now if I play Knight C6, big chance that he's gonna go Bishop C4 or Bishop B5, which allows castling on his next turn,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 and as far as I can see, castling also loses the right to castle, since you can only castle. Once.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Just like condoms, you only use them. Once.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Therefore, Knight F6. Just take my pawn and we'll go for some hyper-aggressive lines dude.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Or not. But still, that helps delaying his Bishop's development, which delays castling, which extends the video.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Knight C6. Of course you'll pin me down, right?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Perfect. H6. The longer I can delay castling, the longer the video gets.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Bishop takes F6. Queen takes F6.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Knight C3. Bishop C5. It would be perfect if he could just move his Knight away right now, but of course, let's not put in too much hope.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 D4. Ah ha, he's obviously baiting me to go Knight takes D4, which is the best move, but then he'll go Knight D5,

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 which kinda forces Knight takes F3, Queen takes F3, Queen takes F3, G takes F3, and there's no way for me to stop him from castling Queen side.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Therefore, E takes D4.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Knight takes D4. That blunders a horsey.

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I'll take with Bishop.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 F3. Ah ha. I was expecting Queen F3, but F3 is obviously baiting me to go Bishop takes C3 check, B takes C3, Queen takes C3 check,

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 which gives him a full reason to move his King, which loses the right to castle, which makes me a fool, for forcing him ending my own video.

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 This guy is indeed really tricky. Knight E5. Since he tried to trick me twice, let's try to trick him back.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Oh no my Bishop.

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Ah ha. I activate my trap card. Knight takes F3, check.

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Fun fact, when I analyzed this game after it was done, I saw.. this. Knight takes F3 is brilliant.

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 I mean that move was pretty obvious to find, so I really don't know why Stockfish is so obsessed with this one.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But still, that is my first brilliant move ever, and when you think about it, my first ever brilliant move,

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 actually happens when I was smurfing against a 100 rated opponent, trying to do some random challenges for a YouTube video.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 I'm not gonna lie, that's actually pretty sad.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 But anyway, why is he still thinking, "Just take my horsey dude"?

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 No don't tell me you're gonna move your King.

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 This guy has just ended my video, on my first ever brilliant move.

33
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 [click]

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Yeah. It took a while, but I finally managed to finish it.

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:27,000
