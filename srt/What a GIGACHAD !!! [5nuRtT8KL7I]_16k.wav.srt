1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 100 rated chess, but every piece, or pawn, that is on a prime number rank, cannot die.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,440
 Luck based challenge. For those of you guys who don't know, there are a lot of prime numbers,

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,640
 but in this game, we only need to care about 2, 3, 5, and 7, which means that if there is anyone

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:29,280
 dies on one of these ranks, the video ends. E4. E5. I mean it's pretty risky to put materials

5
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,240
 on a mission rank, but as long as nothing crazy happens, I think it's going to be fine.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:42,080
 Okay it's not fine. Knight c6. All right now there are queen takes h7 queen takes f7 queen

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:51,120
 takes e5 ending the video, but who plays like that anyway. Right? No doubt. Knight f6. Well I

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,240
 mean I actually cannot take his queen because it's on a prime number rank, but if he can just play

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:04,080
 queen g4 right now to avoid the mission's rules, that will be very convenient. Of course it doesn't

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,720
 happen. Bishop e7. Queen f2. I really want to go d5 to open up the board, but that's just provoking

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,520
 him to end my video. So I guess, castle. To be honest this is quite a peaceful game for the 100

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:27,360
 rated elo. Nevermind. I really want to go knight d4 to threaten knight c2 forking his king and rook,

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,880
 but as you can see, the c2 pawn is on a prime number rank, which is not available for this

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:44,880
 video. Therefore, d6. H5. Very aggressive. I need to stop that. Rook h4. Ah ha, the 4th rank is

15
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,200
 literally the only free rank that I can use to attack his army. Therefore, knight back to d7.

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:59,920
 Bishop c4. After all of those moves, I can finally make some progress. That blunders a rook. I mean

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,800
 I actually still cannot take his queen because it's on a mission rank, but if he can just take

18
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,920
 my bishop right now and blunder his queen on a normal rank, that will be very convenient.

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,280
 I solemnly swear, and I know that you still don't believe, but this guy is not a paid actor.

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:26,480
 Queen takes h4 check. King e2. Testosterone. Knight d4 check. I bet he doesn't have enough

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:34,960
 testosterone for this one. Sir, I'm very sorry I underestimated you. That blunders a king to knight

22
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,920
 c5. Knight a3. Queen e1. Knight e2. Knight e2. Random move. Knight c1. Bishop e2. Queen e2.

23
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,440
 Checkmate in 5. But those moves require me to capture on the 2nd rank, which is against the

24
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,840
 rules, not to mention that I actually didn't see that during the game. Queen f4 check. I have no

25
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,120
 doubt that he'll go king d3 instead of cowardly retreating. That's a real man right there. Knight

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,800
 c5 check. King c3 is forced. A5. Knight e2. Aha! Now comes a very interesting situation.

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,240
 I really want to go b5 with the idea of "Oh no, my queen and b4 checkmate with a pawn",

28
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,960
 but there is a chance that he'll see my checkmating threat and go bishop takes b5,

29
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,160
 which ends the video.

30
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:29,040
 You know what? After seeing my opponent's tremendous amount of testosterone,

31
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,000
 I can't afford to play such a coward move against him. Therefore, b5. Oh no my woman.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:56,880
 Ha! There we go. B4. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

33
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,440
 (shimmery music)
