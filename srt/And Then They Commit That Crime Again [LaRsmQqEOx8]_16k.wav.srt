 100 rated chess, but your pieces regret killing. After making a capture, they have to sit down

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,840
 and think about what they've done for 3 turns before they can move again. Man, just like what

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:21,120
 I do after climax, we get an exact 100 rated American. Knight c3. e5. The plan is very simple.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:28,960
 Checkmate him, without having to capture too many things. Knight f3. Knight c6. So far so good.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,400
 Nevermind. That blunders a horsey, but if I take it, my queen won't be able to move for 3 turns,

6
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:43,840
 so a continuation like d4 bishop takes is very likely to happen. So I guess, bishop e7. To be

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,760
 clear, I'm not a coward, I just don't want to lose my queen in a challenge that my plan is to quickly

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:58,720
 checkmate my opponent's king. Knight takes f7. Ah ha. Now I can take it. Alright, now my king won't

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,000
 be able to move for the next 3 turns, but to be honest, I don't think he can do anything to me

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,640
 during that time. h4. Very aggressive. I want to take that pawn, but then they'll be g3 g takes h4

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:21,120
 because I cannot move my bishop due to the rules, so I guess, d5. h5. Again, very aggressive.

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,920
 Knight f6. Knight takes d5. That blunders a horsey. I mean technically if he plays e4 right now,

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,720
 he can easily take my knight because I cannot move it due to the rules, and he did. You know what?

14
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:46,480
 I have an idea. Bishop h4. Oh no my horsey. That horsey is dead. Queen f6. Oh no another horsey.

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:56,880
 Ah ha. That blunders a king. Queen takes f2. Checkmate. And as usual when the video is so short,

16
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,240
 I'll answer some of your comments. Hold up, are you a cc++ c# programmer? Well since no one uses

17
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,560
 exclamation mark equals instead of less than greater than unless dot dot dot. Sir? I'm a

18
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,240
 youtuber. Jokes on you sim, I slowed the fast forward to 25% speed and watched the moves happen.

19
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,440
 Jokes on you indelicato, I actually wanted you people to do that. That fast forward was all we

20
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,280
 have ever asked, thank you sim. Okay I actually have nothing to say about this comment, except

21
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,640
 the fact that at the moment I took this image, this comment got two f***ing thousand thumbs up,

22
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,560
 while my video only gets over three thousand. How the f***
