00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 100 rated chess. But it's bingo. The game of bingo is statistically fair for everyone,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,400
 and theoretically speaking chess is also statistically fair for everyone,

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,920
 so this video is even fairer than your country's law. We get a 154 from France. I have always

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,800
 wondered how can a maidenless survivor day in Paris while watching people all around the world

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,280
 kissing on the city street, so I can only hope the sky is not having to suffer it. But anyway.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:39,680
 E4. E5. The easiest square to start with is obviously the very center.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,560
 Knight C6. And I mean even though the challenge told me to move my king forward,

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,120
 it didn't prevent me from pulling him back. King E1 is best. And I'm not a coward.

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,440
 Knight F6. There is only one square with a time-limited challenge,

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:07,280
 so I should obviously do that square first. D3. Queen E7. Bishop G5.

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:17,120
 H6. Bishop takes F6. Ha, even though this is just an equal trade, I still managed to get a +3

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,480
 material advantage within 6 moves, therefore I'll say that this square is a success.

13
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:33,520
 And don't argue with me. G takes F6. Well I guess may as well go for this column then. Knight C3.

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:43,920
 F5. Very aggressive. I'll take. E4. I'll take again. Recapture is best.

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:52,480
 Didn't happen. But that is still a free horsey. Okay I actually need him to stop blundering

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:00,240
 pieces and then surprisingly resign the game. Thank you. And you know what, performing a losing

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,320
 trade and giving 3 checks, make an amazing opportunity, for queen takes D7. Queen takes.

18
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:17,920
 Knight D5. Queen B5. This guy has just blundered all of the major pieces he has, within a single

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:29,280
 move. What a legend. Rook D1. Please check me. Maybe not. But now I can at least do the 3 checks

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:40,480
 one. Knight C7 check. King F8. Rook D8 check. King G7. I don't want to make any more captures as it

21
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,320
 only provokes my opponent to resign sooner. Rook D1. And he should be able to see, that queen A5 is

22
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:57,520
 a fork. Bingo. Mission accomplished, and since from now on it is only a normal game with me smurfing

23
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:11,040
 at my opponent, I cannot afford to show it on screen, therefore the video ends right here.
