00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 If your piece, not pawn, is a knight's distance away from your opponent's same piece, the video ends.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 For example, if this position happens, the video ends.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Okay, so I guess, he means that, if two mentioned pieces are a square root of 5 distance from each other, the video ends.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 You know, the Pythagorean theorem. Like, this is 1, this is 2, and this is square root of 1 squared plus 2 squared.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 No? Oh well. Anyway. Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Alright. This shouldn't be too hard. But only if I can remain my focus on the game. And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 We get a 2 0 8 from the US.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 E4.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 E5. Still theory.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 I really want to play knight F3, but after knight C6, there's a threat of knight D4, creating an L-shaped knight's distance, aka, a square root of 5 distance, with my knight.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So I will have to move my knight again to avoid that, which is obviously not good.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Therefore, knight C3.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Knight F6.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 F4.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Vienna gambit.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 There's no way he's taking my E-pawn. Right?

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 E takes F4.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 E5.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 There's no way he's playing knight E4 or knight D5. Right?

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I mean there's obviously a safe square right here. Dude.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Why is he thinking for so long?

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Queen E7.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Thank you.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Queen E2.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Since he saw those two squares are not available last time, there's no way he's playing these moves now. Right?

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 D6.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Yes.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 That blunders a horsey.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 G takes.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Oh, so he wants to keep his woman above him, instead of putting her above me.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 That actually makes sense.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Knight F3.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Knight C6.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Ah ha! He's obviously trying to go knight D5, creating a square root of 5 distance with my knight.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Therefore, D4.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 What the f-

37
