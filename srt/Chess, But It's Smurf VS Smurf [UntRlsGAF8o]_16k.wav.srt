1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 If my opponent is not a smurf, the video ends.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,860
 In case you don't know, there are actually a ton of smurfs in the 100 rated elo, and

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:17,120
 when I make videos, I always just delete those records that I get a smurf opponent.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,960
 And with that out of the way, let's start the game.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,440
 We get a 100 rated smurf from the US.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:31,280
 Yeah, not just being a smurf, he really got his elo to the lowest point like I did.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,880
 E4.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:40,080
 Yes, the best opening move, definitely suitable for a game between 2 smurfs.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,760
 E5.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,280
 Queen H5.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,200
 Ah, since he's a smurf, and he doesn't know that I'm also a smurf, he's obviously wanting

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,800
 to win this game fast, and also trying to teach a 100 rated like me about the 4 move

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
 checkmate.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
 Nc6.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,560
 Sadly, I'm not interested in being checkmated.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,640
 Nc3.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,960
 Ah ha, since he saw that I defended my pawn, he immediately realized that his opponent

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,160
 has already known about the 4 move checkmate, so he changed his playstyle to another thing,

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,440
 but still very carefully kept the way open for his queen to come back.

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,440
 Nf6.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,440
 Nd5.

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:36,760
 Ah ha, since he's a smurf, he wants to give a 100 rated like me some material advantage,

23
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,600
 so that the game is fairer.

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,320
 Well, I'll take it then.

25
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,760
 I'd better take all the advantages that he gives me, before he decides to play seriously.

26
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
 Nf3.

27
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,880
 Ah ha, here comes the serious smurf.

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 Bc5.

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
 Bc4.

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
 Alright I'm scared.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,880
 Castle.

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
 Ng5.

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:10,760
 Ah ha, he's probably calculating, that after I take his knight, he can play d4, which is

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,720
 a double attack on my queen and my bishop, so he will at least win back a piece, but

35
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,440
 will also have a chance to straight up winning my queen.

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,320
 But sadly, after I take his knight, he's missing that I can also take his pawn on g2, which

37
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,960
 will then threaten to win his rook.

38
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:34,560
 Therefore, queen takes g5, even though that knight move was a blunder, I strongly believe

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,920
 that he's a smurf, and his rating is about 1000 rating points.

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,480
 Castle.

41
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,040
 Yes, you see?

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,600
 Right after I took his knight, he realized that he's made a mistake, and immediately

43
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,800
 castled to defend his g-pawn, instead of continuing on his previous plan.

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,160
 Nf4.

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,800
 It's too hard to defend my c-pawn, so I want to force a knight trade instead.

46
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,800
 Yeah, he's not a smurf.

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,800
 I'm a smurf.

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 Bye.

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,380
 (upbeat music)
