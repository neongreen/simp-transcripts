1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
 I'm good at skipping the next 10 moves.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,480
 No?

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,040
 It was supposed to be.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,960
 I'm better than my viewers?

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,640
 Mountain of faith.

6
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,640
 Let's go.

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:15,200
 Ladies and gentlemen and everyone else, welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers,

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,440
 and the victim viewer this time is a guy called, The Real Deathmash.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,640
 Man, I've always thought chess was a friendly game.

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,320
 I'll take this pawn.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,400
 Now he can make a queen on this side, but if he somehow decides not to do it, that will

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,800
 be very convenient.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,280
 Well, very convenient.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,640
 I'll take it then.

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,660
 H G2 H G2 K G2.

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,240
 C takes B3.

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,880
 You may be wondering, why didn't I take this pawn that is obviously becoming a woman in

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,520
 the very next move.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,920
 Well, that was actually my bad, but in my defense, this game was played at 10 PM in

20
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,120
 my place, I was a bit asleep, so I accidentally let him have this woman.

21
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,600
 F1 changing gender.

22
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,120
 Alright, change of plan.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,680
 D takes E5.

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,440
 If he has queens on both sides of the board, I'll play in the center instead.

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,560
 D E5 E D5 E D5 Bishop D5.

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,160
 Rook takes D3.

27
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,720
 Ah ha.

28
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
 Bishop takes C4.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,360
 I bet you've never seen, a triple skewer.

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,760
 Only in this channel do these things ever get to happen.

31
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,520
 Rook D5 Rook D5.

32
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,680
 Ha, the skewer is still there.

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,320
 B takes C3.

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:38,440
 That pawn going down means this game going down, I have to take it.

35
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,180
 Queen takes F3.

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,880
 Bishop C6, I need to be careful though, because even though my position is significantly better,

37
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,300
 I don't want to get into a position with only my bishops and knights, because as I said

38
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:56,000
 in the previous videos, I cannot checkmate with only those types of pieces.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,400
 Queen C3.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,000
 That blunders a lot.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,560
 Rook takes D1.

42
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
 E4.

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,720
 Can't save both women.

44
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,160
 Rook takes E3.

45
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,480
 Ah ha.

46
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,960
 That blunders a bishop.

47
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,160
 I mean if he decides to trade rooks, that will be a bit problematic for me because I

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,440
 will only have 1 rook for a checkmate, but since he's down so many materials, trading

49
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,640
 right now is not such a good idea.

50
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,080
 Right?

51
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,720
 Rook takes E3.

52
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,480
 That blunders a queen.

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,920
 Rook E4 F E4 Bishop E4 Queen E4 Rook E4.

54
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,720
 King takes H2.

55
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,280
 That blunders a very easy to see checkmate in 7.

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,200
 Bishop F4 King H3 Knight G5 King H4 Rook E7 G3 Bishop E2 G2 Rook H7.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,360
 Checkmate.

58
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,160
 I'm better than my viewers.

59
00:02:47,360 --> 00:03:01,960
