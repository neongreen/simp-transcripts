1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 If Stockfish thinks that the game is balanced, the video ends.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,080
 First three moves don't count.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,280
 Disclaimer.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,800
 I only use Stockfish's evaluation after the game is already done,

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,600
 which means I didn't use it during the game.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,000
 And with that out of the way, let's start the game.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,760
 We get a 100 rated from Mexico.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,720
 E4.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,240
 Sicilian.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,280
 Wow. I would love to have a Sicilian game with a 100 rated opponent,

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,200
 but sadly, I'm actually making a video, so it's pretty much not possible.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,800
 Queen H5. Don't panic guys, I have a plan.

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,840
 G5. That blunders a pawn, and as you can see, the evaluation went to 1.1 for me,

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,200
 which is more than enough to continue playing normally.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,880
 But sadly, I didn't know that during the game.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,080
 Therefore, I went for the safe route.

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,000
 Queen takes F7. Check.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,160
 King takes F7. My plan was to give him a free queen,

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,000
 so that he's up a ton of material, and then I'll find a way

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,280
 to shift the game from his advantage, straight towards a forced checkmate.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,640
 Bishop C4 check.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,680
 King back to E8. Oh wait. I have an idea.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,440
 Bishop back to E2. Can you see my idea guys?

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,800
 Knight H6. And since my 100 rated opponent saw my idea,

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,240
 I will assume that all of you guys did too.

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,040
 D4. Since I already lost a queen, who cares about another pawn anyway?

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,880
 Knight F5. And look at that E-val bar. But it's only been move 7 into the video,

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,800
 which means the video is so short. Well who cares, bishop H5, checkmate.

29
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,880
 And since the video is so short, I'll answer some of your comments instead.

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,920
 That's not not even close, it almost ended your video.

31
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,760
 Well, not even close. Imagine living in Asia and not knowing

32
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,320
 what croissants and mukbangs are shake my head my head.

33
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:33,200
 Well, I'm very sorry for that. What's an M? So in case you don't know

34
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,840
 about it, I would prefer you totally not knowing

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,640
 about it, and it's purely for your own goo- Oh wait he knew about it. Yikes.

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:55,440
