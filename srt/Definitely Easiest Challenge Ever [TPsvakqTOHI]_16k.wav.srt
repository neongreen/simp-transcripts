1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 100 rated chess, but your king always has to be in the opponent's territory.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,840
 Open parenthesis, the other 4 ranks, close parenthesis.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,000
 I normally don't take on impossible challenges, but I'm kinda feeling lucky today.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,280
 So you know, maybe something good can happen.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,520
 We get a 129 from the US.

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,560
 For those of you who couldn't understand the challenge, it basically requires me to

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,520
 move my king into this area, and then continue to maintain the king over there.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,760
 Which is really hard.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,600
 E4.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,040
 Still theory.

11
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,720
 E5.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,480
 To make things absolutely fair, I will not move anything else until my king can reach the area.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,040
 Bishop's E4.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,560
 Here we go.

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,000
 King E7.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Testosterone.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,480
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,240
 How about this?

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,400
 King D6.

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,720
 I bet he doesn't have the guts to continue.

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,280
 Guys, please trust me.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,880
 This is not a paid actor.

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,480
 But anyway.

24
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,480
 King C5.

25
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,320
 Get rekt you motherf**ker, you cannot further advance your king, no matter how much you want to do so.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,960
 Ha!

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,120
 I can see the desperation in that move.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,960
 King B4.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,360
 Alright, now that my king is in his territory, I can finally play the game normally, as long

30
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,800
 as he doesn't attack the king.

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,560
 Nevermind.

32
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,880
 King C5.

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,920
 It's fine though, I'm predicting queen A4 will happen, and even though it may take a

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,800
 while, I will move my king all the way to the other side, which should be really good

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,440
 because his queen is too far away to attack me.

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,180
 Ha!

37
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,160
 Exactly as planned.

38
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,600
 King D6.

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,840
 Knight F3.

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,040
 I'm sorry Edward, I have no choice but to sacrifice you for the video.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,640
 King E7.

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,280
 Knight takes Edward.

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
 King F6.

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,360
 If he's nice enough, he will let me take his knight to avenge Edward's death.

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
 Of course it doesn't happen.

46
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,960
 King G5.

47
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,120
 Alright, just one more move, and we go all out.

48
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,840
 Knight E5.

49
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,600
 That move is weird, because in case you didn't notice, he actually missed the fork a few

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,760
 moves before, so I'm pretty sure there is no way he's seeing it this time.

51
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
 King F4.

52
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,880
 Ha!

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,320
 It's all over now.

54
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,840
 Wait what?

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
 When I say it's over now, I totally did not mean it this way.

56
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,520
 But anyway.

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,000
 Mission accomplished.

58
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,160
 Mission accomplished.

59
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:08,800
