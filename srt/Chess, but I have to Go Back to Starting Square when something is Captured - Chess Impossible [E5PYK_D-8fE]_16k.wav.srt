00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Good evening Agent Sim. This is an emergency. Our army has been fighting way over aggressively

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 in our recent battles. Your mission. Should you choose to accept it? 100 rated chest.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 But you have to retreat a piece back to its starting position, every time a capture happens.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Good luck Agent Sim.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Wait. That's it? Why is he so rushing in delivering the mission today?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Well, I guess I'll know tomorrow. For now, let's just find an opponent.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We get a 2-22 from Mexico.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 H4. Ah ha. It's been a long time since I last see the card as opening.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 But anyway. According to the mission, I think I only have to retreat if my opponent takes something from me.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Because you know, how can I capture something, and retreat something at the same time, right?

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Okay. Normally, people will play D5, planning that if white goes rook H3, bishop takes H3, wins a rook.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 But no. Because if rook H3 really happens, bishop takes H3, knight takes H3, and then I have to move a piece back to its original square.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 But since I don't have any pieces developed yet, so I can't retreat any pieces, which fails the mission.

14
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 So I guess, it doesn't really matter. E5.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Knight F3. Ah ha. He's provoking E4. But I think I shouldn't expand my position too early, which may cause a lot of captures.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Therefore, knight C6. My knight actually just stands there for fun. Because if he really takes my pawn, I'll have to retreat a piece back.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Which means I can't recapture.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 D3. D5. Let's play really aggressively, since I cannot recapture a capture, which means I should capture first, and then let my opponent recapture.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Knight C3. Knight F6. More pieces developed, more chances for retreating them.

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 E3. Bishop B4.

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 A3. I'll go back.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 B3. That looks like a mouse slip. But anyway, I'll take a free knight.

23
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Queen D2. Ah ha. He's obviously trying to confuse me by giving me a fork. But of course, I'll take... the queen.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 King takes. Very aggressive. But anyway, that's a capture. Therefore, knight back to G8.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Bishop B2.

26
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 F6. I'm not Ben Feingold, pretty sure that F6 was the best move.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 G4. Again, very aggressive. But anyway, that blunders a pawn.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Bishop to E2. Knight H6.

29
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Rook HG1. Ah ha. He obviously saw my knight was already defending my bishop, but he still wants to attack it with his rook, which means he should be wanting to sacrifice his rook.

30
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 But if he really takes my bishop, I'll have to retreat something back, which means I won't be able to recapture.

31
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Therefore, I'll deliver the strike first.

32
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Bishop takes F3.

33
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Bishop takes. Knight back to B8. Is he going to c?

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Rook takes B7. Knight G8 is forced. Bishop H5 check. King F8 is forced. Rook F7 check. King E8 is forced.

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Bishop to G7 check, and then make a draw by repetition?

36
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 No he didn't. That blunders a bishop. But of course, knight G8 is forced. And now it's become me blundering a rook.

37
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 But it doesn't even matter, because if he really takes my B7 pawn, I don't have any more pieces to retreat, which means I'll fail the mission.

38
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000

39
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
