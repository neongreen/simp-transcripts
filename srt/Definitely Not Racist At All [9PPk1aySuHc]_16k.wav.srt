 100 rated chess, but white pieces cannot be taken on white squares, and black pieces cannot be taken

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:15,680
 on black squares. Not pawns. This is going to be annoying. We get a 290 from Saudi Arabia.

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:25,840
 If my pieces cannot die on the light squares, I'll put the pawns there. E5. D4. Still theory.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:37,360
 No more theory. D takes E5. Knight takes E4. Aha! So the best continuation should be bishop C4,

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,400
 he makes a random move, and then there is bishop takes F7, king takes F7, queen D5, check king E8,

6
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,280
 queen takes E4 and I win a pawn, but sadly, king takes F7 actually kills my bishop on a light

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:01:01,120
 square, which is against the rules. Therefore, bishop D3. D5. Aha! Taking his knight and trading

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,520
 queens to make him unable to castle should be my best choice, but sadly, D takes E4 also ends the

9
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,800
 video, not to mention that I also cannot capture his queen on a dark square. So I guess. On passant.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,520
 Knight takes. Knight F3. An absolutely normal development move. That move is definitely not

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:33,520
 normal. Knight C3. Knight F5. Taking that knight is just provoking him to end my video. Therefore,

12
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,480
 knight D5. I'm attacking his queen and threatening a fork right now, but before the video continues,

13
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:45,200
 I just want to say that YouTube has finally given me the power of the join button.

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,720
 If you like my videos and want to support me with your real money, that button will do the job,

15
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:58,480
 and you'll also get some very special privileges back. But anyway. Queen D6. He's obviously

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:05,760
 threatening to take my knight and also ends the video. Therefore, A4. He should be able to see

17
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:14,240
 that queen takes D5 is blundering bishop B5 check with a discovered attack on the queen. Right?

 [Bloopers]

19
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,640
 By the way, for those people who are thinking that there is C6 blocking the check and also

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,360
 defend the queen, jokes on you, queen takes D5 still happens and the C6 pawn is pinned so it

21
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,080
 cannot recapture the queen. But anyway. What the f-
