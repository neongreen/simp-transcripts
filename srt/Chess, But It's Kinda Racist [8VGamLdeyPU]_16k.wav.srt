00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 100 rated chess, but you can only land your pieces and pawns on a different color square

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,800
 from where your opponent landed theirs.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,280
 Alright then.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,480
 We get a 2 1 3 from India.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,960
 e4.

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,800
 That pawn landed on a light square.

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,720
 Therefore, e5.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,560
 Queen f3.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,480
 Light square again, knight f6.

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,480
 I have to be really careful, because if he takes something, I won't be able to take back.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:41,000
 For example, if he takes my knight here, that is a dark square move, which means I cannot

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,580
 take back, since I'll have to make a light square move.

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:51,520
 But of course, there's no way he's going to make such an absurd move like that.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,480
 Right?

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,560
 Bishop c4.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,960
 Another light square move.

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,920
 Bishop c5. Oh wait, don't tell me you're gonna play d4 here.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,560
 Phew!

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,960
 Thank god.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,400
 I was worrying that he was going to play d4, which blunders a pawn, but since it's a dark

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,880
 square move, I won't be able to take it or move my bishop away, so instead of me winning

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,280
 a pawn, it's him winning my bishop.

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,680
 But anyway.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,960
 Knight c6.

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,280
 I wanted to move my bishop away, but that's against the rules, so I decided to put more

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,720
 pressure on d4 instead.

27
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
 G4.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,520
 Very aggressive.

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,800
 Knight d4.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,840
 Queen f5.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,360
 That blunders a queen.

32
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,760
 But I can't take it due to the rules.

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,760
 I also can't fork his king and rook, also due to the rules.

34
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,920
 Alright.

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,560
 It's fine.

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,960
 D6.

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,440
 If he blunders it once, he will blunder it again.

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,400
 And it happened sooner than I expected.

39
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:12,040
 But once again, I can't either take the queen, or take the fork, due to the rules.

40
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,520
 Even worse, instead of me forcing his queen to move, now it's him forcing my queen to

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,520
 move, or else I lose.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,880
 Are you serious?

43
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,720
 And he resigned.

44
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,600
 I solemnly swear that this guy is not a paid actor.

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,400
 Or at least, I didn't pay him.

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
 But anyway.

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,520
 Mission, accomplished.
