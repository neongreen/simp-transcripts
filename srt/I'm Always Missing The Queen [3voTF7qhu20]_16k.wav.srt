00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 I'm better than my viewers? Of course I am! Morning everyone, welcome to another I'm better

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,440
 than my viewers video, and the unlucky viewer this time is a guy called onechessilver.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,720
 I have no idea what that name means. Knight g5, developing a horse he cannot be a bad move.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,560
 Knight e7. I'll copy him. He copies me. Rook h3, rook a6 expected.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,800
 Ah ha, instead of copying each other again, he chose to move his queen, just to flex that I'm

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,280
 actually maidenless. King g3 then, I mean since he wanted to flex with his queen, maybe he will

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:50,240
 decide to move her again. Of course that doesn't happen. Rook h6 check. Knight d6. So I looked at

8
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,840
 stockfish lines after the game was done, and in this position, stockfish actually suggested me to

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,440
 go rook d6 king d6 knight d4 cd4 knight e4 d4 rook a2 knight a2, which means I will be sacrificing

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:11,040
 2 rooks and a horse c, just to win his queen. Which is obviously very stupid. Knight e5 check.

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:21,280
 King b5. Ha, no need for stockfish, I can still win his queen. Knight c3 royal fork. King a6.

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:30,400
 In between move, bishop f1 check. Let's see if he has the gut to go here. Coward. Knight takes a2.

13
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,880
 Knight recaptures. And in this very position, I went for, knight e6. I was so focused on forking

14
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:47,280
 his queen, and yet I also blundered a fork. He saw it. King h3 knight h6 knight c7 bishop c7 knight

15
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,560
 e7 bishop c8 knight f3. Man, I'm playing so badly today, should have moved the king to g2 instead

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:03,360
 of h3. Bishop takes king g2 rook g6 king h1. Knight b4. Bishop g2. It's funny that I played

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,240
 bishop f1 to check his king in the past, just to move it back after I've cornered my king.

18
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,360
 Bishop f5. Knight h4. Rook g4. Knight takes knight takes e4 d takes bishop takes,

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,080
 and then he went for, rook takes f4. As you can see, each of us only has 1 rook,

20
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,760
 and if we trade them off, it is just a draw. So of course I traded. Bishop takes. I'll take this

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,880
 pawn as well, and after a few moves more, draw by insufficient material. And as usual, since I

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,040
 started in a worse position, I'm better than my viewers.

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:57,680
