 100 rated chess, but it's September the 11th, you must only use your towers and pawns to win the game.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,520
 If you lose any of the towers, the video ends. Let's just hope that I won't get demonetized.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,120
 We get a 151 from Canada. I can only play with rooks and the useless soldiers,

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,800
 so the first move is quite obviously... h4. The famous card is opening.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:37,840
 g6. Not very aggressive. Rook h3. d6. Ah ha, he wants to crash my tower, so I have to move it.

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,800
 It's actually really sad to think that the US couldn't move their towers to another place like

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:54,160
 I'm doing right now. e5. Queen h5 will be very annoying. g3. Bishop g4. I'll move it again.

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,800
 Knight c6. Ah ha, I can take this pawn, but if I do it right now, he can go rook b8 which

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,640
 actually traps my rook and can force a rook trade. Therefore, I'll push this pawn instead.

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,960
 Knight d4. Ha, now I can take this pawn. Rook b8 doesn't trap my tower anymore,

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,280
 and in no world do you take this pawn right here to force me end my own video.

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,800
 No world, including this one.

13
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:35,600
 Of course. I don't really like rook a3 that is too easy to be attacked by the opposite bishop.

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:45,520
 a5. Making room for rook a4. Knight f6. Rook a4. If he could move his knight to another place

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,800
 right now to blunder his bishop, that will be very convenient. Sadly he's not a paid actor.

16
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,720
 Rook b4 setting up a trap for long castle and rook b8 a very nasty checkmate in one,

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,920
 but based on how this guy has been playing, I don't think he knows how to castle yet.

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:12,880
 So I guess. Rook c4. d5. I'll take this pawn. In no world do you take my rook right now.

19
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:25,120
 Bishop d6. Wait. Now what am I supposed to do? He blunders a queen, but knight takes his end in

20
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,560
 the video, and if I move this rook out of the bishop's attack, the other rook dies to the queen,

21
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,360
 so instead of me attacking his queen, it's actually him pinning my rook to my other rook.

22
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:45,680
 What kind of tactic is this? Well anyway, I think I have to capture. I mean a backward knight move

23
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,520
 is very difficult to see, and who knows, maybe he'll resign after losing his woman.

24
00:02:51,520 --> 00:03:05,920
