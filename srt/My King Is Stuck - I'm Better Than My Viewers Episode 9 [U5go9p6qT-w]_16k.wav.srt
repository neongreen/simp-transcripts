1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 I'm better than my viewers, and as the situation suggests, I guess I'm playing white. The challenger

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,920
 this time is a guy called LOD. The weakest point of a pawn chain is definitely their starting points,

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:23,120
 therefore, G2. Rook K7. Oh, I've just realized that even if I play B2 now, there is still

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:31,360
 absolutely no way to defend my C1 pawn. So I guess, E5, if I can't defend, of course I'll attack.

5
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:38,960
 Knight D5. That blunders a fork, I mean if he can just feel embarrassed and then resign right now.

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:47,520
 Nevermind. Let's take this knight. But still, even though I've just won a knight, it's still +13 for

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,520
 him, so the situation is actually not that much better. Queen takes. E4. So in this position,

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,160
 even though the valuation bar on the left is only saying -18, there is actually a checkmate in 8 for

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,480
 black, so if you're interested, please feel free to pause the video to find it, but for me, I'm

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:17,120
 totally not into such absurd thing. Knight B6. E3. As long as he doesn't go rook A1, I can still

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:26,560
 slowly make my progress. Nevermind. Alright, panic time. E5. I mean if he can just blunder his queen

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:35,760
 right now, that will help me. A lot. Sadly he's not a paid actor. King up, have to advance everything

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:44,640
 if I want to win. Rook takes C1. Okay, at least now there is no more pawn for him to take. C4.

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,200
 I mean -21 is actually not that bad, but actually, when I run this through stopfish after the game

15
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:02,320
 is done, it's actually -72.9. Which is to say, really bad. Queen A4. Very aggressive. Now I'm

16
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,560
 sure that all of the pawns in this side is gonna die sooner or later. Therefore, I'll use the other

17
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:19,120
 side. Bishop G4 check. F3. Bishop takes F3 check. Oh wow. So even though stopfish didn't seem to

18
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,800
 like that move, I actually think that was a very good move, because now if I take with pawn,

19
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,160
 there is a checkmate in 5 of rook H2 check. F2 rook D1. King D1. Queen A1. Check. King E2. Rook

20
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,440
 H1. And my king is literally stuck in the middle of his own soldiers. Therefore, king takes F3 is

21
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,880
 kinda forced. Well I mean that blunders a lot of these pawns, but that's still a lot better than

22
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:54,240
 blundering my king. Rook takes D1. This check is too dangerous, therefore, F2. Man I really just

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,600
 want to resign right now, but the video is still too short to be ended. Queen takes E2. A desperate

24
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:09,120
 move. E6. I mean if he can just make some random moves and allow Edward to E7 and F8 to change his

25
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:17,200
 gender, that will be very convenient. Of course it doesn't happen. G4. Now there is a checkmate

26
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,440
 in 2 of rook H3 king G2 and queen F1, but it is actually very hard to see because he needs to

27
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,400
 notice that his queen will be defending his rook by X-raying through my king. And he saw it. By the

28
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,320
 way, this guy is only 900 rated. King G2 is forced. Well maybe he doesn't see the final blow.

29
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:57,440
 Well, I'm still better than my viewers, but this guy, and only this guy, is equal to me.

30
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,520
