00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 I'm better than my viewers, and I don't know what this is for. But anyway, welcome to episode 12 of

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,280
 I'm better than my viewers, and the challenger this time is a guy called ProDud, and it's Dud,

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:22,400
 not Dude, with a rating of whopping 2158. And of course, having a position of -9 against a 2100,

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,520
 is probably not gonna turn out well for me. Let's get a why first, of course I cannot beat a 2100

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,440
 while being maidenless. Knight g3. Ah ha, he's obviously trying to make way for his g-pawn,

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,720
 and also trying to attack my bishop. So I guess, knight f7. Since I'm already down too many pieces,

7
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,960
 I think it's better to just gambit a bishop to slow him down for another move.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,440
 That bishop is dead. And by the way, that was frank. I'll take this queen. Ha, guess who's

9
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:05,120
 maidenless now. G2. Ah ha, after losing a wife, we can see that he's just really rushing to get

10
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:13,200
 another one. Queen takes h8. The plan is simple. G-pawn changes gender, knight takes f5, g takes

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:22,800
 f5, queen takes h7, checkmate. Of course a 2100 is gonna see that. I'll get another wife. Ha,

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,520
 jokes on you, now even if you get a wife, I still have more maidens than you do.

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:35,840
 G3. Ah ha. Coward. Even though he's having a massive advantage according to Stockfish,

14
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,400
 he's literally making room for his king to run in case I move my women into the attack.

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:49,200
 Queen takes h7. Knight e5, that knight is too dangerous, I have to take it. F takes,

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,240
 alright, it's time to make the ultimate move. Queen takes g6 check. The plan is very simple.

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,640
 King takes g6, queen e8 check will prevent his king from running away,

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,880
 which then opens up a chance for me to make a 3-fold repetition draw.

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,440
 And of course, there's no way a 2100 was gonna fall for it. Knight c4. I'm obviously threatening

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,600
 knight take c5 checkmate in 1, but as we all know for sure, there's no way an elite 2100

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,960
 rating points like him is gonna fall for this one. And then he said, I see what you're doing

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:31,040
 with that move, you're trying to get a 3-fold repetition. Dude, I didn't even know what this

23
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,360
 guy is talking about, I absolutely didn't see any repetitions in this position, and since I'm a nice

24
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,720
 guy, I decided to be honest with him. Dude, I didn't. I just centralized my horsey. Well the

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,000
 idea was actually checkmate in 1, but he saw that already, so there's no need to say that again,

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:59,040
 and I'm still a nice guy. And then he said, oh. G1 equals queen. Just for this case only,

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:06,240
 I think that no one is gonna believe me, even if I solemnly swear like usual. But anyway. Knight

28
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,800
 take c5, checkmate. I'm better than my viewers.

29
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:25,440
