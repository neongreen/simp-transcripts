 100 rated chess, but all pieces and pawns must be adjacent all the time.

 Disclaimer. This video is only for entertainment purpose,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,440
 please don't try to stay adjacent to other people in the real world with a pandemic going on.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:28,080
 Let's go. We get a 135 from Colombia. Well, now E4, D4, C4, or any other 4s,

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,800
 is gonna end the video. But you know, there's nothing I can do about it.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:41,040
 No. I disagree. Let's just say, the first move doesn't count.

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,800
 E5, my E pawn is next to his E pawn, so it doesn't end the video.

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,680
 No. How about, the first 2 moves don't count.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:03,040
 And I'm not a coward, I'm just trying to be fair. D5, okay. Now the challenge really starts,

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,800
 and I think we can all agree, that this, can also be considered, as adjacent.

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:18,880
 E takes D5, queen H5 is a threat, therefore, knight F6, and in no world do you play D6 now.

12
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:32,080
 Yes, D6 is a threat, therefore, bishop D6. Queen G3. Very aggressive. Castle. And since my king

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:40,720
 is not in the center anymore, in no world do you play bishop B5 now. Knight F3. That blunders a

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:50,320
 horsey. E4. Knight G5. Aha, that blunders a queen. But should I even take it though,

15
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,280
 because after I take his queen, he can get to play D6, which ends the video.

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:05,760
 You know what? I don't believe. Bishop takes G3. Okay, now just calm down, and take my bishop.

17
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:15,280
 Perfect. There's a free pawn on D5, but of course, that will leave his knight very lonely on G5,

18
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:23,120
 which makes me a fool, for ending my own video. Therefore, queen D6, he should be able to see,

19
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,320
 that bishop B5 is blundering queen takes D5, forking his knight and bishop.

20
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:42,880
 He saw it. Knight D7. Rook F5. Very aggressive. Knight E5. Rook takes E5, queen takes E5,

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:49,200
 now D4 ends the video, but he should be able to see, that there is E takes D3 on passan check

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,120
 king D2 queen E2 check king C3 queen takes C2 check king D4 queen takes C1 winning a bishop,

23
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,160
 a rook, and his king is in the middle of the board.

24
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:16,160
 What the f-
