1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 100 rated chess, but the bishops can't die, and after round 3, any pieces, not pawns,

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,760
 they touch become holy and can't kill anymore.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,920
 Sounds very impossible.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,840
 It is very obvious that my C file bishop is the most annoying piece because it is touching

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,840
 my queen.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,000
 Therefore, d4, I need to move this piece of crap away from my queen before we reach move

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,320
 4.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,320
 d5.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,760
 Here we go.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,680
 Bishop g5, I mean bishop f4 was more natural, but I don't want this bishop to touch my knight

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,040
 on f3 in the future, provided that he doesn't attack me now and make me waste a move instead

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
 of moving my knight out.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,520
 Nevermind.

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,080
 I'll go back this way.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,360
 Knight c6.

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,880
 Ok, now the challenge truly begins.

17
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:58,040
 My king, my g knight, his queen, his king, and his g knight, must never capture anything

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,740
 from now on.

19
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,960
 Knight f3.

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,560
 In no world do you take this pawn here.

21
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,560
 No doubt.

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,600
 e3, I mean my bishop still has his own value, so I'll try to find a way to use it without

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,480
 harming the video.

24
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,800
 b5.

25
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:21,820
 Ah ha, the mission said the pieces that touch the bishops won't be able to capture, so that

26
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,760
 obviously doesn't affect the bishops themselves, because the bishops never touch themselves

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,480
 like you guys do.

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,760
 Therefore, I'll take this pawn.

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,280
 Ok no one argues about that, and now since my bishop is also touching this knight, this

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,160
 knight now cannot take anything, so in no world do you take my pawn now.

31
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
 Of course.

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,600
 I'll go back, ok even though my bishop isn't touching his knight anymore, his knight still

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,680
 must not capture anything, so once again, in no world do you take my pawn here.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,060
 a5.

35
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,060
 Very aggressive.

36
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,200
 Knight e5, in no world do you- oh.

37
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 Wait.

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,440
 When you really think about it, that is actually his best move.

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
 My bad.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,240
 Man, this video is so f***ed now, because it was me taking away his capturing right,

41
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,440
 and then it was also me giving him a capture that is literally the best move.

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,640
 It feels like I'm actually the paid actor in this video.

43
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,640
 Ha.

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,640
 Nevermind.

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,640
 I'll take this animal, ok now in no world you take my bishop.

46
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,220
 Of course.

47
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,120
 And resignation.

48
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,340
 I mean that was such a mess, but we made it in the end.

49
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:54,040
