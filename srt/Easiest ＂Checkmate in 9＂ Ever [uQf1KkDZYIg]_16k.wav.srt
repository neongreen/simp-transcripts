1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 100 rated chess, but your pieces, not pawns, are lovebirds, if one piece dies, you must

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,320
 force its partner to also die.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,920
 The movie of Titanic disagrees with this.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,300
 But anyway, I guess we can just assume that the same pieces are lovebirds, and the king

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,080
 is obviously paired with the queen, which means if my queen dies, I'll have to let my

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,160
 king be checkmated.

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,360
 D4. Since the pawns are not affected by the challenge, it's absolutely fine to let them

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,080
 die. And as usual, Edward dies first.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
 He's dead.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,360
 Knight C6. The plan is very simple. Since the challenge implies that I should not be

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,880
 trading any pieces because each piece basically worth double the value they usually worth,

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:55,120
 the England gambit will help me to only use my queen to cause all the damage in his territory.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,320
 Or he can just develop his queen first to stop me from developing my queen.

14
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,080
 Knight B4. Alright, let's try to get his queen then.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,640
 Queen B5. Aha, that blunders a fork, but if I take his rook, big chance is that I will

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,000
 also lose my knight, and then according to the rules, the other knight also has to die,

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,520
 which means I'll be losing 2 horses for a rook, which is definitely not a good trade.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,600
 Therefore, A6, in no world do you take my horsey right here.

19
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,540
 Are you serious? That blunders a woman, but as the challenge said, I have to sacrifice

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,440
 the other horsey first. Alright, now take this horsey and blunder your queen again.

21
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,200
 Sadly he's not a paid actor.

22
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,280
 Knight E4. Queen takes E4. It's fine, it's not like I need those useless horses to win

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,120
 this game anyway.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,400
 Bishop C5. Queen A4. Very aggressive.

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,920
 B5. Queen A5. Bishop B7, this guy has only moved his queen this entire game and still

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,880
 managed to absolutely destroy my position.

27
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 Nevermind.

28
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:20,480
 A takes B5, 2 knights 2 pawns for a queen, it's not even that much profit.

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,480
 Queen D2. Very aggressive.

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,400
 Queen G5 check. I mean if he can just go back to E1 and blunder checkmate in 1, that will

31
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,540
 be very convenient.

32
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,840
 Of course it doesn't happen. In this position, there is a very easy and very obvious to see

33
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,360
 checkmate in 9 for black, so if you're interested, please feel free to pause the video right

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,560
 now and find the checkmate, while I keep on continuing this video because that is obviously

35
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,720
 too easy for me to see.

36
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,280
 Queen takes E5. To be clear, this move is not the correct checkmating move, it's just

37
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,280
 because I'm avoiding spoiling the challenge for you guys.

38
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,560
 E3. Bishop E4 check.

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,440
 King D2. Queen D5 check.

40
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,600
 King C3. That blunders a king.

41
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,720
 B4. Checkmate with a pawn.

42
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,320
 Mission, accomplished.

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:31,100
