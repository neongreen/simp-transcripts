00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
 100 rated chess, but you are a coward, which I am obviously not, you can only move a piece,

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,840
 or pawn, to a square if at least 2 other pieces, or pawns, already defend that square.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,760
 So even though I'm obviously not a coward, I still have to do this for the video.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,960
 We get a 3 1 0 from Poland. All squares on 3rd rank are obviously defended by either 2 pawns

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,360
 or a pawn and a horsey, therefore the best move right now, has to be b3. The plan is obviously

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,640
 to pianketto my bishop, and I've just realized that I actually can not do that because there

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,560
 are not enough pieces defending the b2 square. I am so f***ing stupid.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:54,240
 E6. Not very aggressive. Knight f3. It's fine, it's not like this very small pawn push is gonna

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:05,360
 destroy my position or anything. D5. E3. Bishop c5. D4 is defended by my e-pawn and a horsey,

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:15,200
 therefore, pawn to d4. Bishop b4 check. Aha, now pawn to c3 is best, but since the c3 square is

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,440
 only defended by 1 piece at the moment, I have to block with a piece. Well technically I can also

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:29,760
 move my king forward, but maybe that is a bit too much testosterone. Queen d6. Now 2 pieces are

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:41,360
 defending c3, c3. Bishop a5. c4. Don't tell me that you're just gonna move back to b4. Okay.

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:50,720
 Knight takes. Queen a3. Bishop e2. Just a random waiting move, since I didn't have any good moves

15
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,000
 to make, and even though I usually try to attack and win my opponent's queen when he moves her

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,920
 forward, based on my calculation in this challenge, if I want to take his queen, I'll need to have at

17
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,280
 least 2 pieces attacking her at the same time, which means I need my opponent to blunder his

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,360
 queen at least 3 moves in a row, which is basically impossible, so I'm just not gonna care about his

19
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:22,400
 woman in this game. dc4 knight c4 queen e7 coward. e5 is defended by these guys. Knight f e5.

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,840
 Knight c6. He wants to take my knight, and since that knight is defending d3 with my bishop,

21
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,240
 queen d3. Need to make good use of that horsey before he dies.

22
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:43,120
 F to our horsey. e5 is still defended by this knight and this pawn, therefore, d takes e5,

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,640
 the challenge only said that the square has to be defended by 2 pieces, and didn't say that I

24
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,640
 cannot move one of those pieces to that square. Queen b4 check. Ah ha, blocking the check should

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,600
 obviously be the best move, but just for this one time, king f1. Trust me, I have a plan.

26
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:12,960
 b5. Very aggressive, d1 is controlled by my bishop and queen. Rook d1. Oh no my horsey.

27
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:22,960
 Your sacrifice won't be in vain. d8 is controlled by this battery. Queen to d8. Checkmate. You may

28
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,680
 be wondering how did my rook can see through his queen and control a square all the way to

29
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:39,680
 the other side of the board. Well, I decided it that way.
