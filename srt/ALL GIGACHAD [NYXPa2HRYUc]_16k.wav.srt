 100 rated chess, but your king is a giga chad. Your king must reach the other side of the board

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,080
 to flex on your opponent, and this part doesn't sound very giga chad, so let's change it to.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:19,600
 I cannot make any cowardly moves. Let's go. D4. Since I cannot make any cowardly move,

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,120
 the first move obviously has to be. E5. I'm sorry Edward, your sacrifice will be the biggest proof

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:36,240
 of our bravery. Wow. I can't believe Edward actually survived that. But anyway. Here we go.

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:46,000
 King E7. F***ing giga chad. E4. Okay so I probably shouldn't go further, and that is definitely not

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,600
 because I'm a coward. F6, solidifying my center. F4. Very aggressive. Not taking that pawn is

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:04,880
 obviously a cowardly act, therefore, E takes F4 is kinda forced. Knight F3. D6. Okay I mean these

9
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,320
 one square pawn moves look pretty pathetic and not very giga chad, but I actually think that

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:20,080
 they are very aggressive because of some unknown reasons. Trust. Bishop takes F4. Bishop G4. H3.

11
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,040
 Ah ha. Pulling the bishop back is obviously a coward move, therefore, I have to take this.

12
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:37,280
 Queen takes, knight A6. E5. That blunders a pawn, I mean if he can also blunder his bishop next,

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,840
 that will be very convenient. Oh wow. This has to be one of the very few times I see a 100-rated

14
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:55,040
 player makes a pin to save his piece instead of moving it. Knight C5. Queen B4. Ah ha, now if I

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,240
 move my king out of the pin, both his bishop and his queen will be under threat and there is no way

16
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,680
 he can save both of them. But of course, moving the king out of the pin doesn't sound very giga

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:14,720
 chad. So I guess, king testosterone D6, man that looks like a gigantic blunder. Bishop takes E5.

18
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,520
 Ah ha, F takes looks like a coward move, so of course, king takes is f***ing forced. And for the

19
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,600
 first time ever, Stockfish actually agreed with me, king takes E5, is best. Giga chad Stockfish

20
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:38,960
 today. Bishop C4. That blunders a woman. Knight D3 brilliant move C takes D3 bishop takes B4.

21
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,240
 Okay now do not resign please, my king is in the middle of the board, you still have a lot of

22
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,920
 chances, and I haven't even used my queen yet, so there's no need to quit the game just because of

23
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:59,520
 a woman. Thank you. Here. King D4. Okay now my king is literally next to all of your pieces,

24
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:07,760
 just march everything at him. Why didn't he resign right after he lost his queen then?

25
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,120
 What the f-

26
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,680
 What the f-

27
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:24,080
