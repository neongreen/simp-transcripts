00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 100 rated chess, but all checks must be captures and all captures must be checks.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,000
 I can't believe that people can react into the word hard,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 when this is such an extremely easy challenge. We get a 174 from Brazil.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,120
 Very handsome. E4 knight c6 d4. Nothing to think about yet,

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,080
 this challenge is way too easy for me to spend my precious time to actually build a plan.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:40,080
 Knight c6. E5. Knight e4. Aha! That blunders a horsey, but since I actually cannot take it

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:46,880
 because that capture is not a check, bishop d3 instead. I'm trying to provoke f5 protecting the

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,360
 knight, so that my pieces will have more chance at checking his king in the future.

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,480
 Didn't happen. This capture is still undoable, and I have a feeling that this game is going

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,960
 very wrong very quickly. Let's try to end it real fast. This officially saves his knight as now he

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,840
 can play f5 and don't have to worry about f3 anymore. Nevermind. Blocking with knight or

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,080
 bishop is just provoking a capture that I cannot fight back. C3 is kinda forced.

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,840
 And in no world do you take this pawn. Or that pawn.

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,760
 Wow! Now everything is hanging, but nothing is hanging.

15
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:39,120
 Well, you know what they say. If your opponent hangs 3 pieces at once, you attack their king.

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,480
 Queen h5. The plan is very simple. He takes my bishop. I move my king. Then I move my knight,

17
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:55,520
 I move my knight, I move my queen checkmate. Exactly as planned. King e2. This is not a royal fork.

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:22,320
 You know what? I'm not gonna play this game anymore. Have a great day.

19
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,900
 (upbeat music)

20
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,900
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
