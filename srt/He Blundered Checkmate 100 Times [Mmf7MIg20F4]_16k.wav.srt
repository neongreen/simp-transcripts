00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 100 rated chess, but you cannot capture a piece, or pawn, unless it has captured a piece,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:15,520
 or pawn, of yours. This is going to be annoying. We get a 100 rated from Vietnam.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:23,120
 D4. Since I cannot capture anything unless it has captured something, I believe that my opening

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:33,920
 should be a gambit. After he takes my pawn, that pawn can be taken. Perfect. Knight C6. Well of

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,760
 course there are situations where I cannot take back the pawn, but still, it's fine to play a

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:52,000
 gambit opening. Queen D5. Very aggressive. F6. He takes F6, knight takes F6, of course my knight

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,400
 cannot take his queen due to the rules, but you know, he doesn't know about that. Queen F3. Ha!

8
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:11,600
 Coward. Bishop C5. Queen E3 check. Very aggressive. That blunders a woman, but since that woman hasn't

9
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,800
 captured anything yet, I cannot take it, due to the rules. Therefore, bishop back to E7.

10
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,000
 Queen G3. Man, this guy has to be the most aggressive opponent I have ever met.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,280
 He's obviously calculating castle and bishop H6, and even though I have rook F7 after that,

12
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,920
 I actually want to go for, king F7. I mean since he's playing very aggressively,

13
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:49,840
 why not give him a target to attack. Queen G5. Yeah, come at me baby. D5. Let me predict.

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:59,520
 Queen H5 is coming. Ha! How did I know that? That blunders the queen again, and again,

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:10,160
 the rules are ruining the fun. G6. Queen H6. Too aggressive. Bishop F5, I mean that attacks the

16
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:23,280
 C-pawn, but again, I can't take it. C3. Coward. D4. C takes D4. I'll take with queen. On second

17
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,200
 thought, knight takes would have threatened knight C to checkmate in one, but I mean queen takes is

18
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:41,760
 not so bad anyway. Knight A3. Let's give a check. Bishop block. Knight E4. Knight C2. Ah ha,

19
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,480
 that blunders bishop takes D2 check king D1 knight takes F2 checkmate, or bishop takes D2

20
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,960
 check queen takes D2 queen takes D2 checkmate, but since his bishop hasn't captured anything,

21
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:03,680
 I cannot take it, due to the rules. So I guess, queen back to D6. Man, after so much effort I've

22
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,960
 put out to set up a checkmate, the rules just simply jumped in and ruin everything. Bishop takes

23
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:21,120
 B4. Knight takes B4. Knight takes B4. Queen takes B4 check. As you can see, it is either queen D2

24
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:29,280
 queen takes D2 mate, or king D1 knight takes F2 king C1 queen E1 mate. But sadly, the rules are

25
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,800
 once again, stopping me from doing those. King D1. I mean getting the rooks in for a checkmate is

26
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:53,040
 easy, but I prefer the hard way. G5. Knight H3. Ah ha, finally. Queen D2. Checkmate. Mission

27
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:04,640
 accomplished.

28
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,220
 (upbeat music)
