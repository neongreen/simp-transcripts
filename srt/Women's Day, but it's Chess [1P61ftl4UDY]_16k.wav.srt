00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but it's International Women's Day, your queen is MVP of the game,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,080
 making the most captures, the most moves, and delivering checkmate. The last part obviously

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,880
 sounds way too luck-based, because my opponent will most likely resign the game as my queen

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,920
 is causing chaos in his territory, so I guess, I'll completely delete that part.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,080
 That sounds much better, but before the video begins, have you ever been in a situation that

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,000
 you are about to checkmate your opponent and then they said, resign right now or I'll expose your IP

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,880
 address to everyone on the internet? Well, with NordVPN, you don't have to worry about those guys.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,720
 Anymore. Is your computer full of malware because you didn't know anything about computer so you

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,720
 accidentally downloaded them and then don't know how to get rid of them? Well, then I would suggest

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:00,240
 you clean your SSD first, and then go for, NordVPN. Are you tired of seeing unnecessary too many ads

11
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:06,320
 on every single website that you visit? NordVPN can remove those ads for you. Are you living in

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,480
 a country that bans YouTube but somehow still able to find my videos? I bet you are using,

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,960
 NordVPN. If you are interested, check out NordVPN at their website through the link in the description

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,880
 below, or if you have too much time to spare, just pause the video and type this link with your own

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:34,560
 hands in a new browser tab. Back to the game, we get a 1 1 7 from Italy. E4. E5. This makes my

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,080
 Epawn is the MVP of the game since he's made the most amount of moves, but in order to move my

17
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:49,680
 queen out, I of course need to make way for her first. Knight F3. Here we go. Queen F6. The massacre

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,120
 starts here. Knight takes E5. That blunders a horsey, and unlike all of those videos where

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,720
 there is always a random reason preventing me from taking that horsey, this time, I'll take

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,360
 it without a doubt. Now my queen is officially the MVP of the game, let's just not let any pieces take

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,600
 their position away from her. Queen F3. It's going to be hard to play with only a queen. Bishop C5.

22
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:27,040
 Please don't offer a queen trade. Of course I cannot let my woman die on women's day. Queen E7.

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,200
 Also need to be careful though, I cannot let his queen be the MVP instead of my queen.

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:42,080
 My woman is better than yours. Bishop C4. Ah ha. He's trying to attack my Epawn, and even though

25
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,360
 my queen is obviously already defending it, there is always a chance that he cannot see it and

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,240
 proceed to take the pawn which forces a queen trade. So I guess. Knight F6. Completely preventing

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:04,880
 the threat is definitely the better idea. And no, I'm not a coward. E5. Very aggressive. Knight C6.

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,920
 To those of you who are about to comment that I'm blundering a horsey, you suck. Bishop E6.

29
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:20,800
 What kind of move is that? He is sacrificing his bishop just to unpin his pawn, but I cannot take

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,600
 his bishop with my queen because of a possible queen trade. I cannot take his bishop with my

31
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,720
 pawn because that will force him to move his queen more times than I move my queen. I also

32
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,440
 cannot retreat my knight because of the F7 pawn. So in conclusion, what the f*** am I supposed to do?

33
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:46,240
 Ha. My queen moved 3 times, which is the most in this game, but she has only captured once,

34
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:52,320
 which equals to his dead horsey. So I guess. Mission. Kinda accomplished.

35
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:06,960
