 100 rated chess, but every 5 turns you offer a draw. If the opponent accepts, you lose.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,800
 Too easy. We get a 2 0 7 from Naru.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,320
 E4. So to make him not accepting my draw offer, I obviously need to give him some advantages.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,360
 B5. Ha, now after he takes my pawn, he'll have 1 point of material advantage,

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,040
 which will massively decrease the chance that he'll accept the draw offer.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,880
 E5. Alright, I'm literally blundering 2 pawns at the same time,

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,440
 so if he doesn't take one of them, I'm down to just never play chess again.

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:48,720
 Of course. Knight F6. Take this one too please. Maybe later.

9
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:56,000
 Knight C6. Alright, I'll have to offer a draw next move. So please, just don't make a blunder

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:08,560
 right now. Are you serious? Alright. I have an idea. Draw offer. I want to take that knight,

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,240
 but if I do that right now, he will definitely accept the draw offer, which ends the video.

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,160
 Therefore, I'll sit here and wait for him to decline the offer first, and then I'll take that knight.

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:32,240
 Aha! He declined it. Now that blunders a horsey. I mean if he can just resign right now feeling

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,360
 bad about blundering a piece and declining a draw offer. That will be very convenient.

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:45,840
 Of course that doesn't happen. I'll take this pawn. Alright, I'm giving you back the horsey,

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,760
 just take it and don't accept the next draw. Or not. Knight D3. Okay now please take it.

17
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,760
 If he doesn't take it this time, I have no idea what to do after this.

18
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:06,320
 Thank you. Knight F6. Since he was the one who makes the last capture, his fighting spirit must

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,760
 be very high right now, so I'll say that we don't have to blunder anything more until move number

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:20,720
 10. Queen E3 check. Bishop blocks. Alright, once again, please don't blunder right before the draw

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:31,360
 offer. Good. Draw offer. And to make him not accept this draw. Rook B8. He should be able to see,

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,920
 that now he actually has bishop takes E7 brilliant move knight D5 bishop D8 knight E3 bishop E7

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,200
 knight C2 knight C3 knight E1 rook E1 winning two pieces for a rook. Right?

24
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:50,000
 What the f-
