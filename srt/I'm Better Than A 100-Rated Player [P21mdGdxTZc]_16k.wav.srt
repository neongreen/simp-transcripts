 100 rated chess, but it's a decisive victory. You must not lose even a single piece, or pawn,

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,720
 and you must take every piece, and pawn, your opponent has. Another impossible challenge,

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:23,520
 but I'm not a coward. We get a 2 46 from chili. E4. Since I'm not allowed to lose any materials,

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:30,720
 pushing center pawns sounds a bit too dangerous. Therefore, knight C6. I mean some people will

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:41,280
 just play E5 here and blunder their redward. Right? Bishop B5. Aha, of course I cannot allow

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,640
 him to take my knight. Therefore, knight E5. Man, maybe developing the knight first is a huge

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:57,440
 mistake. Queen H5. Wow, it feels like he just wants to flex that I cannot move any pawns to

8
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:06,800
 defend the knight. Knight G6 is kinda forced. Queen G4. Knight F6, I mean I would be very happy

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:16,640
 if he can blunder his queen right now, but there's no way that can happen. Right? Of course. C6. In

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:26,240
 no world do you take this pawn here. Knight C3. Aha, that blunders a bishop, but if I take it,

11
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,840
 knight takes B5 will end the video. So I guess, queen B6, now he definitely has to retreat his

12
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,120
 bishop. Or not. Somehow I have a feeling that this guy knows what I am doing right now.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,960
 How about this. A6. Alright, now there is absolutely nothing else he can do to keep his

14
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:58,400
 bishop here. Queen E2. That move doesn't work. A takes B5. He should be able to see, that knight

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,280
 takes B5 is blundering a knight, queen takes B5 is blundering a queen, and A takes B5 is the worst

16
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:15,840
 move which blunders a rook and get my rook straight into his territory. Right? To be honest,

17
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,440
 I kinda saw that was coming, but since the video is still very short, I'll answer some of your

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,720
 comments instead. I do hope you're going to name all the pawns now. I actually did do that in

19
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,200
 another video, and not just the pawns. All the pieces were given names as well, please feel free

20
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:42,480
 to check it out, link to this video is in the description. No no, you don't get to escape with

21
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:50,160
 a draw lmao. Counting that as a win for the other guy. I disagree, a draw is a draw, and a draw is

22
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:58,080
 not a win. Jokes on you, I have the power here. Just like the last video, get your queen out as

23
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,840
 soon as you can when his king is in a vulnerable. No, don't tell them the secret man, the series is

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,200
 called I'm better than my viewers, and definitely not all of my viewers can checkmate me.

25
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:24,000
 *Outro*
