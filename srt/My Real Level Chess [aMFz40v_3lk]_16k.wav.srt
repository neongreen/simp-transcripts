1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 100 rated chess, but you actually play against someone your level.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:11,440
 Very clear and simple. I normally play E4 against people at the 100 rated era,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:19,280
 but in a more serious game, I tend to play D4. Knight C6. Meichner's defense,

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:29,200
 I'll take the full center. E5. D takes knight takes F4. Knight G6. Aha,

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,960
 he's provoking F5 which blunders a pawn to queen H4 G3 queen E4 queen E2 queen E2 bishop E2 knight

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,840
 6 E7 therefore. Knight F3. The situation is actually very good for me as his knight is

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,280
 very limited in places that it can land, nevermind. That blunders a horsey. Well you know,

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,640
 even though this is my real level chess, people still blunder their horses every now and then.

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,920
 Bishop check. C3. Very good move as it stops my knight from being developed normally.

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:13,600
 Bishop D6. Aha. He's probably thinking that my bishop is too strong, so he decided to sacrifice

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:21,040
 a pawn to trade off my strong bishop, bishop takes pawn takes queen takes. Knight F6. He's

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,840
 provoking a pawn push, and since I don't know what plan he's having in his mind,

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,880
 let's just avoid it for now. Queen E7. Aha. He wants to trade queens so that we'll head into

14
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,320
 an endgame with his king on a very strong dark square and I only have a light square bishop that

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,600
 cannot attack his king. So I guess, E5 instead. At least this will force him to make a queen trade

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:57,360
 himself. Well you know, even at my real level, people still blunder their queen every now and

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,040
 then. Resignation. The challenge didn't require me to reveal my rating, so I'll answer some

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:14,800
 comments instead. Please put a stop to these easy challenges. But I lost. You know what?

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,640
 I changed my mind.

20
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:25,920
 So,

21
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,200
 you.
