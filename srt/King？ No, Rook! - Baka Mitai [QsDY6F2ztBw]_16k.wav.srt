 [Music]

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 You're a stupid child

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 You chased your dreams and got hurt

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 You're bad at lying

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 But you showed me a smile that couldn't be laughed at

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 You're bad at saying "I love you"

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 You're really clumsy

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 But, but why

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Did you say "goodbye"?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 You're no good, no good, no good

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 I love you, I love you too much

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 No matter how much I drink

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 My memories don't change

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 You're a stupid child

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 You're a stupid child, really stupid

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 You only believe

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 You pretend to be a strong woman

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 You bathe in the night wind of sadness

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Three years have passed since you became alone

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 You even changed the cityscape

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 You left behind the city of tears

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 You're a really bad man

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I'll take off your ring

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I'll make you pay for it

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I'm waiting for you

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 You're a stupid child

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,160
 (epic fanfare music)
