 100 rated chess, but on each turn you randomly choose between, horizontal, vertical, diagonal,

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,560
 and you have to move that way for this turn. Let's add a number 4. Horsey. Very simple.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:21,120
 First of all, we need to create the directions. Next, we create the exception. Our move is going

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,440
 to be randomly chosen among all of the directions and exceptions. But since my computer is a noob,

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:34,640
 I have to teach him what random is, and then we just need print out the result. Very. Simple.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:43,200
 We get a 2 0 0 from Australia. D4. Alright I mean if I roll horizontal or diagonal here,

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:54,480
 the video ends, but that's life. Ha. Nevermind. Knight F6. F4. No diagonals allowed yet.

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:08,400
 Vertical. D5. Alright, now the game truly begins. E3. Diagonal, bishop G4. I mean there will be a

9
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,120
 small problem if he takes my bishop right now and I cannot roll a knight next move.

10
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:23,280
 But who plays like that anyway? Right? Of course. That blunders a queen, so now I need. Diagonal.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:36,560
 It's fine. Queen C8. Knight F3. Another knight move, knight C6. Bishop E2. Quite frankly,

12
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:50,240
 anything besides horizontal is good now. Of course. Queen D8. Queen A4. Another knight move,

13
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,800
 another knight move, and since this knight is pinned, knight E4 I guess. I can already see,

14
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:04,960
 that this game is going very wrong very quickly. Knight E5. Ah ha, that knight is forking my knight

15
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:16,800
 and my bishop. So please, god of RNG. I need. A diagonal. Thank you my lord. Bishop D7. G3.

16
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,880
 That blunders a horsey, but to be honest, as long as I don't roll a diagonal again,

17
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:31,680
 I'm fine with whatever the result is. Alright, bishop H3. Please get tunnel vision.

18
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,480
 Ha, so he didn't get tunnel vision, but also didn't see the knight hanging.

19
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:50,960
 Another knight move, knight F6. My god why do I keep rolling horses. C takes D5. Okay. RNG god.

20
00:02:50,960 --> 00:03:00,560
 I desperately need. Another knight move. Vertical. Ha. Still fine. I mean I'll be losing my woman if

21
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,840
 he goes knight C3 right here and I roll a knight next. But what are the odds. Right?

22
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,960
 It's fine, it's not like I get another horsey here.

23
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:18,480
 I'm buying another computer. Knight H5. Oh no my horsey.

24
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:30,320
 Ha. Not even close. Diagonal, queen E6 is kinda forced. I mean it's still very bad after D5,

25
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:38,960
 but there is a chance that. Nevermind. Another knight. What kind of 25% is this?

26
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,360
 Knight takes G3. Oh no my horsey again.

27
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:52,320
 You know what, I'm not gonna play this game anymore, this is absolutely impossible. Have a great day.

28
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:06,800
