00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 100 rated chess, but you're not allowed to do best moves. Very challenging, we get an exact

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:14,560
 100 rated guy from Morocco. E4. First move E4 is a book move, and even though it is considered to

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:19,120
 be the best starting move for white, let's just pretend that we don't know about that today.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:28,880
 E6. D4. Still theory. No more theory. Now any of these developing moves can be the next best move.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,560
 Therefore, I'll push this pawn instead. I mean there is no way pushing a pawn that weakens an

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:44,480
 important diagonal is a best move. Right? Of course. D6. Not very aggressive. Again,

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,200
 I'll push this pawn as well. There's no way allowing a massive check is a best move.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:01:00,480
 No doubt. E5. Taking that pawn is obviously not an option. Knight F3. Stockfish? Thank you.

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 E takes F4. Ah ha, even though taking that pawn back is not the best move, if I do that right now,

10
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,000
 he may decide to go queen E4 check, which forces queen E2 unless I want to lose my bishop,

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,320
 and since queen E2 will be the best move in that position, I'll have to end the video. Therefore,

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,640
 knight D2 instead. I mean knight C3 looks like the best move, so I pick this one. Queen D7. Now I have

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,040
 no idea what the best move is, but I do know, that moving a queen is definitely not. Stockfish?

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:44,320
 Absolutely. Queen C6. Knight G5. I mean there's no way moving a knight away from the center is a

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:55,920
 best move. Right? There we go. Knight F6. Okay. Now comes the most important part of this entire

16
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,000
 game. I want to play C5 double threats checkmate in 1 and bishop B5 skewing the royal couple.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,640
 But as you might have guessed, that move looks too strong, and can very much be the best move

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:15,360
 of this position. You know what, since I also need to win this game, I guess I have no other choices

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,280
 but to actually make progress. Who knows, maybe there was a better move in that position and it

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:32,640
 makes C5 not the best move. Ah ha. C5, is a great move, and as far as I can see, a great move,

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:42,640
 is not a best move, which is to say, that this video, continues. Nevermind. Mission, accomplished.

22
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:57,140
