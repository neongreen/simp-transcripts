00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 If you can't overanalyze a move from your opponent,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 the video ends.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Well, you're basically saying,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 that if my opponent makes a move that doesn't make any sense,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 the video ends.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Easy to understand then.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Let's find an opponent.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 [Music]

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We get a 159 from China.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Ah ha! The second smartest country in the world.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 To be honest, I'm pretty scared now.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Thinking that he may be going to play a move that is so brilliant that I cannot understand.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 E4.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Thank God. I can understand that.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 He's obviously want to control the center.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And since E4 comes with the most amount of opening theories in this game,

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I don't think I need to say anything more.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 But now, it's my move.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 I think that, if I want to overanalyze the moves,

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 those moves need to be very tactical.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Therefore, let's go for the most aggressive reply.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 D5.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I know most people are going to say that C5 is the most aggressive reply,

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 but I just don't agree with that.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 [Music]

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Knight C3.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Ah ha! He's obviously wanting me to go D4,

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 knight back to E2,

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 E5, and then knight G3,

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 which actually transfer his knight from the queen side to the king side,

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 which will help him attack my king in the future.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Or even if instead of pushing D4,

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I go D takes E4,

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 he can also go knight takes E4,

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 and then his knight is very strong in the middle of the board.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 [Music]

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Alright then.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 D takes E4.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 The more I open the center,

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 the more tactics going to happen,

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 and the longer the video is going to be.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 [Music]

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Knight takes E4.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Yes.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 As I explained before,

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 his knight now is strong in the middle of the board,

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 and if I go knight F6,

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 he will also take it,

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 and after E takes F6,

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 he will be the only one with a center pawn.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 But actually, I think it's all good.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Knight F6.

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 D3.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Okay.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 So he changed his plan from taking my knight,

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 into if I take his knight,

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 his pawn will take.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Queen trade,

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 and then he is the only one having an active E pawn in the middle of the board.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Therefore, even though D3 is not a good move,

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 it still makes sense,

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 which means,

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 the video, is okay.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 But anyway,

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 knight takes E4.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 D takes E4.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Queen takes D1.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 King takes D1 is forced.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And since that's a forced move,

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I can't overanalyze it,

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 but I believe that the video should be continued,

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 because it's actually the game not allowing me to analyze it,

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 and definitely not me being lack of analyzing skills.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 E5.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Also,

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 the guy who donated me actually required me to analyze all of the moves,

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 but I changed it into only my opponent's moves,

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 since the video would be too long if I analyzed everything.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 F3.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Alright,

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 this move is very understandable,

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 because he just want to give his pawn a defender,

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 and also trying to solidify his center.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Bishop C5.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Knight E2.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 Aha!

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 He's obviously wanting to stop me from playing bishop D4,

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 because if I played bishop D4,

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I would be targeting his B-pawn,

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 which stops him from developing his dark squares bishop.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Therefore,

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 knight C6.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Knight C3.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Aha!

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 It looks like he's allowing me to play bishop D4,

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 but he actually blocks the bishop's view towards his B-pawn,

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 and now his knight on C3 is having a great outpost on D5,

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 because since I have played knight C6,

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 I cannot play C6 to kick it away anymore.

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 So I guess,

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 bishop E6.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 A3.

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Aha!

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Now he's planning to play before,

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 trying to kick my bishop away,

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 so that he can develop his bishop to D3.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Alright.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 I'll castle.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 B4.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Very aggressive.

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 But anyway,

113
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 exactly as I predicted.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Bishop C2.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Let's tickle him a little bit.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 King E2.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 That's a lot of testosterone right there.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Once again,

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 he's obviously wanting to kick my bishop away,

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 so that he can play bishop D3.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 So I guess,

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 bishop D4.

123
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 G4.

124
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 That blunders a horsey.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 And after bishop takes C3,

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 rook B1.

127
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Bishop E2,

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 traps the rook.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 But still,

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 a bad move,

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 doesn't mean that it's meaningless.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 So as long as I can find a way to analyze this G4 move,

133
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 the video is fine.

134
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 Nope.

135
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 I can't think of anything.

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 Therefore,

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 what the f-
