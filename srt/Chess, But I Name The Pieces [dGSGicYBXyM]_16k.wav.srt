1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 100 rated chess, but you random which piece, or pawn, you have to move.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Well, easy then.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 First off, let's build our randomizing engine.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 The codes for this video is actually pretty similar to my last randoming video.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Link in the description below.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 The only thing that changed, is instead of files, we now have, the pieces.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 But instead of putting boring things like, the A pawn, the B pawn, the B file knight,

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I've decided to gave them, some names.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 The first two rows are for the pawns, whose names are not capitalized.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 For example, Bobby Dejango is the B pawn, Federico is the F pawn, and Guadalupe is the G pawn.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 The last two rows are for the pieces, whose names are capitalized at the first letter.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 For example, Benjamin is the B file knight, Carlos is the C file bishop, David, Diana, is the queen.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 We get a 274 from Belize.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Okay. First move.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Should I roll the dice, or should I just flex and say things like,

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 "I will do it from move 5 or something."

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Among the 16 pieces and pawns that I'm having, only 10 can move,

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 which makes the video's chance to survive, is 10 out of 16, which is 62.5%.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And that's actually a pretty small number to be honest.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 But since it's over 50%, I'll do it, to prove that I'm a real man, and not a coward.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Go!

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Annunciation!

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Alright, not a good roll, but at least the video survived.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Annunciation, A3.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 E6.

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Now instead of 10 out of 16, it's 11 out of 16, which is 68.75%.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Still not good. But since I've done it from move 1, there's no way to go back now.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Federico.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Oh no. That's literally the worst roll possible.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 But anyway, I must obey the rules.

32
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Federico F3.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 If now he plays Qh4+, and I don't roll GdL, the video ends.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Thank god.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 He decided to move his queen, but not too aggressive.

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Please roll something good.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Federico again.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 There's no way this is good.

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Federico F4.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Qxf4.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Now he's obvious going to play Bc5, trying to checkmate me.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 So please, give me something that can defend the threat.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Benjamin.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 This guy obviously cannot defend the threat.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 But anyway.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Benjamin C3.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 Bc5.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Yep. I saw that was coming.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 And I'm also pretty sure that I'm about to be checkmated by a 100 rated.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And even worse, I will be checkmated by a bishop.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Therefore, the god of RNG, please, bless me.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Hendrik.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 And he's trapped.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Oh wait.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 If I can't move Hendrik, the video ends now.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 So instead of getting checkmated by a 100 rated, I can end my video.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
 Thank you god of RNG.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:03,000
