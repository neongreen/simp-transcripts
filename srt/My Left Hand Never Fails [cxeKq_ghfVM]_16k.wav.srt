00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 100 rated chess, but you are left-handed, all catches by your pieces and pawns must be to the

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,960
 left. And just for this game, I will also be playing with my left hand. We get a 135 probably

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,560
 right-handed guy from the Philippines. G4. D5. Since bishop G4 is a left-handed move,

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:29,360
 there's nothing wrong with just giving his pawn an attack. Bishop H3. E5. Taking the full center,

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:37,920
 but in fact, I'm actually only taking these 2 squares. G5. Aha, that started a bishop Mexican

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,720
 standoff, and since if he takes my bishop, I actually cannot take back because that move

7
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:51,120
 is to the right. So I guess, I have to... take his bishop. Man I almost mouse slipped there.

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,520
 Knight takes. For your information, I'm using a Logitech G3 O4 wireless mouse,

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,080
 so it is actually not that hard to play with my left hand, not to mention that I used to

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:11,520
 practice my left hand a lot during the time I was maidenless. H6. G takes H6. Rook takes is also fine,

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,040
 but since I can only take to the left, knight takes is kinda forced. Vertical moves are not

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,560
 to the left. Rook G1. Man, if you really think about it, my rook are actually pretty useless

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
 in this game, because they can only capture horizontally to the left, which means their

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,960
 attack power has been nerfed by a whopping 75% damage. Knight F5. Okay I know that move is very

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:51,120
 weird, but trust me, I have a plan. Knight G5. Bishop. C5. Knight F3. Queen F6. Alright, the setup

16
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,400
 is complete, now all I have to do is to kick this knight away from blocking the queen's way to attack

17
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,160
 his king. Or he can move the knight himself and blunder it at the same time. I think the best

18
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,960
 continuation right now should be bishop takes F2 baiting him to take with his king which blunders

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,480
 are very easy to see. Checkmate in 7 starting with rook takes H2, but sadly this move is against the

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:22,720
 rules. Knight G3. The plan is very simple, bishop takes F2, checkmate in 1. Or he can take the knight,

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,920
 that also blunders queen takes F2 checkmate in 1, but since that move is not left-handed.

22
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,840
 Bishop takes F2. King F1 is forced. I don't even want to take his rook to lose my bishop because

23
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:44,400
 my rook is useless. So I'll take this pawn instead. Alright, here's how it's going. King moves,

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:54,080
 I win. Knight blocks, I'm f***ed. Absolutely, queen F2 is checkmate in 1, but as a grandmaster once

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,280
 said, if you see a checkmate, look for better. Therefore, rook H2 king G3 queen F2 king G4 rook

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:09,280
 H4 king G5 queen F4 is checkmate, but he resigned instead. Mission accomplished.

27
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:23,760
