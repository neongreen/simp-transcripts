00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 100 rated chess, but you do my shopping for me. Materials value is converted to USD.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,200
 King's worth 10, I'll cover the cost later. So I understand this as for every point of

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,280
 material I capture. I'll get $1 in return. We get a 140 from India.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,000
 E4. E5. Among all of the challenges I've been through before,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,840
 maybe this is the one that I don't want my opponent to resign the most.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:38,560
 Qh5. A very familiar opening, and unlike usual, I can play the optimal moves this game.

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:47,600
 Nc6 Bc4 g6 Qf3 Nf6. Nothing wrong so far, and the plan is to avoid taking his queen too early.

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,000
 Well, I have no other choices. But this is also a big chance for me, because if this guy doesn't

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,720
 resign after losing his woman, he won't be resigning after losing every other thing.

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:15,600
 Ha! This guy. Is so dead. Bc5 d3. We'll start the attack. Nd4.

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:23,360
 C3. That blunders a fork with a rook, but that scenario is only good in a normal game,

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,960
 where I won't be losing my knight after the capture. In this game, this capture is better.

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,600
 Pawn takes queen takes. Now my queen can infiltrate and deal more damage than if I had taken the fork.

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,360
 D4. That blunders 5 dollars. King up. 3 more dollars.

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,080
 C takes d5. He didn't say anything like losing pieces is losing money,

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:58,320
 so I don't really care about that useless bishop. Check knight blocks +5. Knight develop. Queen c3

17
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,320
 knight e5 queen e5. Alright, here's the situation. His king worth 10 dollars, and the rest of his

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,640
 army is only 8. Therefore, change of plan, we're not capturing anymore. Next target. Nevermind.

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,200
 31 dollars in total, but since there is no way I can fail this challenge,

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,600
 there is no mission accomplished today.

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:38,080
