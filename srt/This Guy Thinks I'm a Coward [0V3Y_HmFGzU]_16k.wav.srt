 This guy is secretly saying that I'm a coward.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 So first of all, f*** you.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 And secondly, a very renowned human being once said,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 "Only kids make choices, adults take all."

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Let's go. We get a 151 from Vietnam.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 E4. The first thing I need to consider is obviously rule number 4

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 keeping at least one of the four knights dim on the rim at all times.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Knight H6 is kinda forced.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Queen H5. I can only use one bishop according to rule number 3,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 and since I'm playing black, my dark bishop should prove more value.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Queen takes H6 ends the video as it breaks rule number 4.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 But who plays like that anyway?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Knight F3.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Rule number 7 requires me to move my king exactly one time this entire game,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 and as you might have guessed, there is only one choice.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Knight E5.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Castle.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 This knight concerns me a lot as knight takes F7, rook takes F7,

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 he can go queen takes F7 check and I cannot capture that woman.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 But to be honest, the chance of that continuation happening is even lower

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 than the chance of you having a girlfriend in the next 10 years.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Exactly. No harsh feeling by the way.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 This bishop is attacking my dimming knight, so I need a backup horsey.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Both bishops capture and there is no way I can save this video,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 but no one plays like that in such an open position.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And I did not see that coming.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Bishop A6 ends the video, but since there is no real way to stop it,

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 and also there is no way I'm turning down this queen,

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I'll take.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 I mean since he played that move in 0.3 seconds,

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 there is no way a resignation can happen right now,

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 but he should be able to see, that he should take this pawn first

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 to attack my rook instead of taking my knight.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 What the f-

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:38,000
