00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,620
 100 rated chess, but when your pieces, or pawns, see another piece, or pawn, dying,

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,340
 they become sad and must die as soon as possible.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:16,600
 Very challenging, just by reading that challenge, I can already see that this video is either

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,300
 going to be the easiest win of my entire life, or the most cringiest pathetic loss ever recorded

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,860
 on this channel.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,860
 E4.

7
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,660
 Knight c6.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,660
 D4.

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,460
 I mean if he takes my D pawn now, my queen will be seeing my D pawn's death, so I'll

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,780
 have to sacrifice my queen as soon as possible, and after he takes my queen, my knight and

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,580
 my G pawn will be seeing my queen's death, so I'll have to sacrifice them as soon as

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,620
 possible, and maybe there'll be another piece or pawn seeing them dead, which means I'll

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:54,020
 have to continue sacrificing those guys, and then the domino effect reaches my king, and

14
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:59,580
 since I cannot sacrifice my king in any ways, I'll have to end my video, which means in

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:05,160
 conclusion, knight takes D4 now is probably ending the video in like 10 moves, but since

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:11,380
 my D pawn is very obviously defended by my queen, there's no way he'll be taking it.

17
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,120
 Right?

18
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,120
 Of course.

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,320
 E5.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,300
 Since I'm attacking his knight now, there's no way he's taking my D pawn.

21
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:22,340
 Right?

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,340
 No doubt.

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,340
 F3.

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,180
 Okay now I guess we don't have to worry about my D pawn anymore because he's obviously

25
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:35,860
 seen that it is defended, so let's just focus on playing the game, properly.

26
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,660
 Knight G5, bishop takes G5, the challenge said my pieces should feel sad when seeing

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:46,660
 another piece dies, but there's no reason to feel sad for your opponent, so let's just

28
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:49,900
 say that it only applies to my pieces.

29
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,100
 F6.

30
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:58,060
 Aha, now bishop F4 F takes E5 will make my bishop seeing my E pawn dies, which means

31
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,440
 I'll have to sacrifice my bishop.

32
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,900
 So I guess, I'll go back this way.

33
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:10,580
 F takes E5, David saw Edward's death, so he has to die as well, but if he dies right here,

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:15,400
 my queen will see David's death, which means she'll also have to die, which is not very

35
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,700
 convenient for a chess game.

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,220
 Therefore, D takes E5, if David dies on E5, no one cares.

37
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,740
 Goodbye David.

38
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,540
 And of course, even though I saw David's death, I think we can all agree that the challenge

39
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,540
 doesn't apply on me.

40
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,820
 Knight C3 C6 F4 Knight G6 Queen H5 E6 Aha!

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,840
 That blunders a queen, and after king takes, no one saw my bishop's death, so that was

42
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,880
 very much a free queen for me.

43
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,340
 King takes.

44
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,300
 Bishop D3.

45
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,700
 Knight takes F4.

46
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,420
 Ha, no one saw that either.

47
00:02:53,420 --> 00:03:01,040
 Therefore, queen H4 check bishop E7 queen takes horse E G5 queen G3 B6 knight G2 A6

48
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,660
 this is very suspicious knight D4 bishop B4 Oh no, that is actually pretty dangerous because

49
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,420
 after he takes my knight, my B pawn will be seeing that, so I'll have to let him die as

50
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,220
 well, and who knows how many pieces will be dragged into the domino effect.

51
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:22,220
 Therefore, I'll give a check, let's try to checkmate him before he can mess up my video.

52
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,620
 King C7 queen E5 check D6 queen G7 check who cares about that trash rook anyway king B8

53
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,540
 that blunders a king knight takes C6.

54
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,540
 Checkmate.

55
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,540
 Mission, accomplished.

56
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:49,300
