1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
 If a queen is f***ed, the video is f***ed.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,120
 And for those people saying that these are forked and not f***ed,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,200
 the truth is this guy actually wrote the f-word in the original message,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,680
 but for the sake of monetization, I had to censor them away.

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,400
 But anyway, this is going to be short. We get a 171 from Colombia.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,760
 E4. I think we can all agree that the challenge actually means that if a queen

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,480
 is blundered, or dies, the video ends.

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,840
 D5. And of course, bringing my queen out in a queen challenge will make it a lot

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,200
 more entertaining. Nevermind. I'll take the gambit.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,840
 Of course queen f3 or queen d3 will immediately end the video,

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,400
 but who plays like that anyway? Right?

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,840
 Of course. Knight c6. The purpose is to provoke d5,

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,640
 and after I move my knight away, his queen will have the d4 square for free,

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,880
 so if he wants to lift his queen up, he won't choose the blunder d3 square.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,080
 F3. I'll take that pawn. G takes. Knight takes d4 wins a free pawn,

16
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,320
 but if c3 comes after that, I will have to move my knight away,

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,560
 and then he can take my queen, which is against the rules.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,200
 Therefore, E5. C3. Not very aggressive.

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,600
 Queen h4 check. King f1. I'll take this pawn. In no world

20
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,280
 do you take with your queen here.

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,600
 That's right. Now knight takes d4 should be the best move,

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,440
 but I have a strong feeling that he will take back with his queen and totally

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,560
 missing that my queen on the side can see that square,

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,280
 because as a grandmaster once said, horizontal moves are very hard to see.

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,960
 You know what? I think it's fine. I have faith in this guy,

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,120
 that he will not blunder his queen like this.

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,440
 Ha! You see? Not only he didn't take that knight,

28
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,360
 he even blocked his queen away so that he won't have to look at that capture in

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,560
 the future. Bishop c5. Knight e2.

30
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,160
 That blunders a checkmate in 2 of bishop h3 king g1 knight e2 double checkmate,

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,720
 but sadly I didn't see it during the game, and instead went for knight takes

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,160
 f3. I'm threatening queen f2 checkmate in 1

33
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,520
 or bishop h3 also checkmate in 1, so he should be able to see bishop b5

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,480
 check c6 knight g3 sacrificing his bishop to give his king some free

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,120
 squares to move after being checked. And of course, since I'm really killing

36
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
 his king right here, he can't even think about moving his

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,120
 queen, not to mention about blundering it.

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,120
 The worst thing is, Stockfish actually said,

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,760
 "Good." What the f-
