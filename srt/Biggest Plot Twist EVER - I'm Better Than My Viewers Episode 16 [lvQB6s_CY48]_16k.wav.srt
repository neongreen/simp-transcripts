00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 I'm better than my viewers, you're white. Okay we can very clearly see that white is having a

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,600
 monstrosity advantage here, so there's obviously no way people are allowing me to play white.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,440
 Welcome to episode 16 of I'm better than my viewers, and today's challenger is a guy called

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,080
 Admiral Sabers with a cat profile picture. And as mentioned before, we are obviously playing black

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,280
 this game. Bishop takes F5. I'll take this rook. Man this really doesn't look good for me.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:38,080
 Bishop takes E6. I mean even though Stockfish thinks this is +20 for white,

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,720
 I actually don't think it's that bad. Knight E takes G4. The idea is if he takes with bishop,

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,840
 there is knight G5 smothered checkmate, but since he's 1100 rated in rapid,

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,480
 there's no way that can ever happen here. Nevermind. Wow.

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 It's 3 moves. Plot twist, after the game, he actually couldn't accept the fact that he

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:14,720
 blundered smothered mate on move 3, so he offered a rematch, and of course, I also couldn't accept a

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,760
 short video only featuring 3 moves and I make absolutely no ads revenue. I accepted the offer.

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:27,520
 And to change things up, I'm playing white this game, and to be honest, maybe the guy who came up

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,400
 with this position actually saw this was coming, so he said that I should be playing white in the

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:41,920
 first place. Bishop takes F5. I'm copying his move here. Rook takes C1. Bishop takes E6. In no world

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:50,080
 do you use my plan against me. King takes E6, and as of move number 2, we have a completely new game.

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,680
 Bishop B3 check. Knight blocks, man I'm having so many pieces it's actually pretty confusing

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,680
 which one to use, so I guess, I'm not using any. Knight takes G4, let's give a check first,

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:14,160
 it doesn't hurt to give a check. King D7. Ah ha, this is probably the biggest ah ha of this entire

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,520
 channel. He is literally baiting me to take his knight and blunder knight takes F2 checkmate in

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,200
 one with a royal fork on my smothered queen, which is going to be the utmost humiliation ever in the

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,160
 history of chess. Therefore, I'm not very interested in that move. Knight takes G4,

23
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:41,360
 that was really dangerous back there. Knight G5 check. King H2. Queen takes D2. Bishop E5 check.

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,760
 King D6. Rook takes E1. King E7. Rook H8. King D6. Ah ha, now there is rook D8. King E7. Rook D7.

25
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,840
 King F8. Rook C8. A very textbook ladder checkmate in 3, but as a grandmaster once said,

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,680
 if you find a checkmate, look for a better one, and in this position, there is something actually

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,880
 even better than that checkmate in 3. Rook C6. Check. King E7. Rook C7. Check. King D6. Rook C6.

28
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,720
 Check. King E7. Rook C7. Check. King D6. Rook C6. Check. And it's a draw by repetition.

29
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,120
 And since I got a draw and a win after 2 games, I'm better than my viewers.

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:35,760
