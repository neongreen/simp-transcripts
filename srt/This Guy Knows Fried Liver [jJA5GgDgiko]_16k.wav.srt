1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 100 rated chess, but you don't have a premium subscription. Each piece, or pawn, can only move

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,480
 5 times throughout the game and then its free trial ends. 5 times obviously sounds way too easy,

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,480
 so let's change it to 3. Now that is a bit more fair. We get a 100 rated guy from the Philippines.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,600
 E4. Since I can only move each thing 3 times, the best way to do it is obviously

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,200
 to go as far as possible. From now on, my E pawn can only move 2 times more.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,480
 Bc4. Moving a queen or a bishop out doesn't sound like a very good idea as their moves

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,360
 are very flexible and there can be a lot of chances to make good use of a move in the future.

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:57,760
 Therefore, I'll move a horsey. Nf3. Nf6. I mean I don't have much faith that a 100 rated guy knows

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:07,600
 about the fried liver attack. I'm very sorry I underestimated you. Alright then. D5. Exd5.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,960
 Ok so the next book move should be Na5 attacking this bishop, but for this game, I think I'll go

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,920
 for, the Alvastad variation. The internet usually mentions this as the Levi-Rosman variation,

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,400
 but no, it's actually the Alvastad variation, and in case you are wondering who Alvastad is,

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:35,920
 I have no idea, but trivial matters aside, let's see if he can see the best move of Bf1 Nd4 c3

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:47,360
 Nd5 cd4 Qg5 Bb5 Kd8 and the position is still very balanced. No he didn't. Qxd5. Well I mean even

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,160
 though he didn't see the best continuation, our positions are still absolutely fine.

16
00:01:52,160 --> 00:02:00,400
 Well, that resignation is kinda what the f*ck, but since I won the challenge,

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,320
 mission accomplished instead.

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:16,800
