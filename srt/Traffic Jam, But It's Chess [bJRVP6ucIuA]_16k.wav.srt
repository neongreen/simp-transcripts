1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 100 rated chest, but it's rush hour, you can only move pieces, or pawns, that block your own pieces,

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,080
 or pawns, from moving. I mean a much simpler solution is to just wait for the rush hour to

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,640
 run out, but you know, maybe this guy is really rushing, we get an exact 100 rated guy from

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,960
 Saudi Arabia. I really want to push a pawn right now, but as you can see, there is no pawn push

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,280
 that fits in the rules, therefore, knight c3, this knight is blocking the way of my c-pawn,

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,640
 so it is following the rules. e5. e4, this c-pawn now blocks the way of my knight,

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,240
 so it is also following the rules. knight c6, I really want to go bishop c4, but since my knight

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:54,240
 has already blocked the way of my c-pawn, bishop c4 actually doesn't block anything's way, which is

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,120
 against the rules. Therefore, let's do knight f3 first, same idea like before, I'm blocking my

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:09,200
 f-pawn's way. knight f6. Aha, I wonder how long has it been since the last time I actually have

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:16,000
 a theoretical opening like this against a 100 rated player. Bishop b5, and of course, this

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,480
 blocks the knight's movement. d5, aha, now knight takes e4 bishop d7 knight takes d7 is obviously

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,960
 the best continuation, but sadly, even though I can take this pawn, knight takes d7 is impossible

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,280
 because that move doesn't block any pieces or pawns that I have. Therefore, I'll take this pawn,

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,400
 blocking my knight by the way. knight takes d5. Okay now knight takes e5 is not even possible

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,160
 anymore, which makes me really regret why didn't I just take it first and then take the other pawn.

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,720
 But anyway, queen e2, the plan is to fix my mistake and take that pawn on the next move,

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:04,320
 because my knight will be blocking my queen's way. Bishop g4, queen takes e5 check. Of course

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,040
 knight blocks and queen e4. Nevermind. That blunders a horsey to knight takes d5, but then

20
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,240
 after he takes my queen, knight takes e5 is impossible because it doesn't block any pieces

21
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,880
 or pawns from moving. Therefore, let's just be safe, and retreat my queen. I'll take with king

22
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:31,440
 if he takes. Long castle. Very aggressive. I'll castle too. No worries, queen takes there is knight

23
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,360
 takes that blocks the way of my bishop. Knight e5. Aha, that blunders a horsey, but again,

24
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,760
 if woman takes woman, I cannot take back because it is rush hour. Therefore, rook e1. Queen e6.

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:56,640
 Aha, finally, queen takes e5. Queen g6. Aha, I think he's trying to win my knight next because

26
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,360
 my pawn will be pinned to my king, which is actually pretty amazing because this has to be

27
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,680
 the first time I've ever seen a 100 rated player trying to set up a tactic to win a piece. But

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,240
 actually, who cares about that horsey anyway. Knight takes d5. That knight is blocking my queen's

29
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:22,400
 way, and oh no my horsey. That horsey is dead. I'm so sorry pal, but you had to die for the greater

30
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:35,840
 good. Queen takes c7. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

31
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,020
 (opening theme music)

32
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,600
 (upbeat music)

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,600
