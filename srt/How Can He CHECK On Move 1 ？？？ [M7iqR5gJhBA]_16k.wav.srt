00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 I'm better than my viewers. No doubt about that. Ladies and gentlemen and everyone else,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,520
 welcome to another I'm better than my viewers video, and the viewer this time is a guy called

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:19,600
 B Roja, with a rating of whopping 2200 points. And don't judge my pronunciation. King takes d1 is

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,760
 forced, having to play a forced move as the first move against a 2200 master is definitely not the

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:35,120
 greatest start ever. B5. That forks my queens, but I'll take this knight first. B takes c4. This is

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,840
 way too dangerous, so even though I really don't want to do it, I have to take this pawn. Knight

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,000
 b6, he forks my queens again, I mean what is the point of having many queens when they always get

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,880
 forked. But anyway, I'll take this pawn, I mean a desperado will make my center totally undefended,

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,920
 which can be really dangerous for my king. A4. And he went as far as making a zwischensunk

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,520
 before taking my queen. Queen takes knight takes and there is still no way for me to defend my

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,960
 center because queen c2 is blundering knight e3 royal fork. So I guess. E4. I mean who knows,

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,760
 maybe he'll sacrifice his rook into this pawn and give me a chance to turn the tide of the game.

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,600
 Of course that doesn't happen. Pawn takes knight takes pawn takes pawn takes pawn takes.

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,520
 Pawn push. I'll sacrifice another woman, I mean after opening up the center,

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,600
 the best thing to do is obviously to get at least one queen into action.

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,360
 Knight takes queen. Queen takes knight. I'm developing a horsey. I'll take this bishop.

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,320
 B takes c3 allowing my queen to go out is definitely expected. Or not. That was computer's

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,960
 best move by the way. Queen takes f4. I mean even though I have an active queen, the situation still

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,400
 looks very hopeless for me. D takes e4. E takes b4. A direct attack at his king can also be

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:15,280
 considered in the future. Bishop d5. I'll take this pawn. Knight e6. I'll take this pawn too.

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:24,400
 Man, just how many pawns does this guy have? G5. Ah ha. Now if I take this pawn with my queen,

22
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,080
 he will have knight f4 forcing me to move my queen back again, which wasted 2 moves in a row.

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:38,640
 Therefore, I'll take with pawn. He plays knight f4 regardless. B5. Alright, this side is already

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,000
 dead for me, let's just try our luck on attacking his king. Nevermind. G2, making a path for my

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,320
 queen to go out. King b6 queen f1 rook e3. And in this position, I thought that everything is

26
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,360
 hopeless after rook d3 check, so after spending like an hour on the clock without finding any

27
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,200
 solutions, I randomly played queen f2, and guess what, he retreated his rook instead.

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,760
 This guy knows for sure he is about to win, so he just wants to mess with me. So I guess,

29
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,080
 I'll speed up the game. And in this position, I resigned. But even though he won the game,

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,200
 he started in a better position, so let's say, I'm better than my viewers,

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
 but this random guy who likes to torture people, is equal to me.

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:40,000
