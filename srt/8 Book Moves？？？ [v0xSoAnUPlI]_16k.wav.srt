00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 100 rated chess, but you can't capture a piece. Not pawn. The turn after it moves.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,160
 Very challenging. We get a 138 from Mexico. With diamond membership.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,680
 E4, nothing wrong so far. Knight f6. E5,

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,080
 let's see if the diamond membership taught him anything about moving the horses.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,200
 Well, that blunders a horsey, but since it's just moved, I cannot take it, due to the rules.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,000
 Therefore, d4, I mean if he can just leave it there for another turn, I can take it.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,520
 Well of course, except for this case. G4. Knight g7. Fun fact, that is still. A book move.

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,720
 I'm really curious to see who wrote this book about the modern defense Norwegian defense 3 e5

9
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:12,320
 knight h5 4 g4 dot dot dot. But anyway, bishop h6. d5. Aha, the French move is possible,

10
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,920
 but sadly, I don't like it. c4. Once again, on passant, is not forced.

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:31,120
 Knight e6. I'll take his bishop. King takes. Very aggressive. c takes d5. Somehow that looks like a

12
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:39,360
 blunder to me, but I don't really know why. Knight takes d4. Aha, now that is really a blunder,

13
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,400
 but since his knight has just moved, I cannot take it due to the rules. So I guess, knight c3.

14
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,720
 c5 is coming, and sadly I have to say, I will once again not take on passant.

15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,640
 Nevermind. That blunders a horsie. And after missing the free knight for like 200 times,

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:13,120
 stockfish says. Great move. F*** you stockfish. Bishop takes g4. e6. f takes e6. At least he

17
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:21,440
 didn't blunder his king, but that still blunders a lot. King f7 is forced. d takes e6 check.

18
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:29,920
 And he resigns. Mission accomplished.

19
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:42,020
