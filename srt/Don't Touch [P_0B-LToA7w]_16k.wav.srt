 100 rated chess, but it's the multiverse. If a piece or pawn meets its enemy counterpart,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,680
 the video shatters. The word "meet" is a bit too unclear. I'll change it to "touches".

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,520
 And let me add another rule. Sacrifices are not allowed. I'll explain it later.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,320
 We get a 176 from India. E4. E5 is making me a fool.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,880
 B6. Before we continue, let's just assume that my light bishop's counterpart is his dark bishop,

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,520
 and my dark bishop's counterpart is his light bishop and not the other way around,

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,480
 and if you want to ask why do I want to do that, am I doing that to make things easier for me?

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:54,720
 Well, f*** you. Queen h5. Bishop b7. The plan is very simple. I take his Edward,

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,560
 and my Edward won't have an enemy counterpart, which means I then can use my E pawn to destroy

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,680
 his entire board. Unless he defends it. This is why I made the no sacrificing rule,

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,600
 because if I just sac my bishop right now, I then can push my E pawn, and then use my E pawn to

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,960
 take another pawn, and then use the pawn counterpart to take another thing, and so on.

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,200
 This challenge will become way too easy, so it's not fair anymore.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:32,800
 Knight f6. Queen f5. G6. It's very funny that he can actually push g4 to defend his

15
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,360
 queen because gf5 is ending the video. But who plays like that anyway?

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:51,200
 There we go. Bishop g7. Queen d4. Ah ha, he's planning to push e5, which is very dangerous

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:59,920
 as e6 ends the video. So I guess, I have to continue attacking. Queen c3. And then I cannot

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,960
 attack anymore. Castle. It's fine, if he can just delay e5 for one move. Nevermind.

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,480
 Ok knight e5. In no world do you push e6 right now.

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
 Ok that wasn't e6, but it still blunders the woman.

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,440
 This knight's counterpart is this knight, so there is nothing to be worried about.

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,840
 Except for e6.

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,960
 Absolutely. There is no optimal way for me to avoid e6, so even though this is really risky,

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:44,320
 I have no other choices. G4 and e6 are ending the video. But he'll take for sure.

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,080
 And even though the challenge said the video shatters, I'm too lazy to make the shatter effect

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,560
 as it requires me to open up after effect and then make a completely separate video

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,080
 just for this shattering section and put the two videos together.

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,360
 I guess I'll just end the video right here.

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:21,360
