 100 rated chess. But you and your opponent cannot capture a piece or pawn with the same kind of

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:17,920
 piece or pawn. Let's go. I normally don't take on easy challenges, but you know, I'm really running

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,920
 out of ideas at this point. Pushing center pawns is just asking for troubles. So I guess, knight f3,

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:38,480
 d5, g3, e6. Not very aggressive. Bishop g2. Well, actually I'm also not very aggressive.

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,400
 Knight f6. Castle. It's pretty amazing how he hasn't made any weird moves when we're already

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:56,320
 3 moves into the game. Ha! Here it comes. d3. I know pushing center pawns is a dangerous act.

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:06,880
 But you know, I also need some center space if I want to win this game. Knight c6. h6. Knight e5.

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,920
 Ah ha! Taking his knight and then go d4 is obviously the best continuation, but that makes

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,280
 me a fool, for ending my own video. Therefore, knight fd2. Of course I also cannot leave my

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:29,200
 knight there for him to take and end my video. Bishop b4. Ah ha! This mission doesn't allow the

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,800
 pieces to murder their own kind, so imbalanced trades like this is definitely good for the video.

12
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:42,560
 Therefore, a3. I mean since he plays bishop b4 right after I moved my knight to d2,

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,480
 there is no way he's not taking my knight, right? Well, I guess everything can happen in this world.

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:59,360
 Knight c3. Ha! Now he decides to take. But anyway, as mentioned before,

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:11,360
 imbalanced trades should be good for the video. B takes c3. Castle. Bishop b2. d4. Ah ha! Taking

16
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,320
 the pawn is obviously the best move, but you know, I don't want to end my video. Therefore,

17
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:27,840
 c4 is kinda forced. Queen g5. That blunders a fork. But should I even do it though? I mean after

18
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:36,240
 f4 queen takes g3 f takes e5, my pawn is too close to his territory, and a move like f6 will absolutely

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:46,320
 destroy my video. You know what? I don't believe. F4. I mean after all of those moves, my e5 pawn

20
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,600
 will be attacked by both his knight and his queen, so there's no reason that he's gonna play a move

21
00:02:51,600 --> 00:03:02,080
 like f6 to threaten my video. Right? Or he can just play like that. Rook takes f3. Well, that was even

22
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,080
 better for me, but of course, the game is still on, and my f-pawn is being a little bit too aggressive

23
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:19,840
 now, which may cause some big trouble in the future. Or not. Ha! Mission accomplished.
