00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 100 rated chess, but you are Batman. You can only capture pieces that have captured your pieces,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,520
 and you only play on dark squares. Each segment of this challenge can even make a challenge on

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:23,040
 its own, but I think I can do it. We get a 182 from Italy. E4. I can only play on dark squares.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,680
 E5. It's actually pretty lucky when I get the black pieces because I can make use of my queen

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:39,680
 and my dark bishop more easily. Qh5. D6 can defend this pawn, but it blocks my dark bishop.

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:51,440
 Qf6 instead. Bc4. Bc5. Qxf7 is pretty concerning because I cannot take his queen on a light square.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,520
 But who plays like that anyway? Right? No doubt. That blunders a pawn and probably will also lead

8
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,880
 to a lot of advantage for me. But since his f-pawn hasn't taken anything from me yet,

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,720
 I cannot take it due to the rules. Nh6 instead. The plan is very simple. He takes my knight,

10
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,440
 my queen recaptures, and as my queen leaves my f-pawn, queen takes f7 king d8,

11
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,240
 then I'll have a chance to sneak my queen straight into his territory and destroy his king.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,600
 Didn't happen. Qb6. In no world do you take this pawn.

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:42,080
 Well that is still acceptable because even though my knight cannot capture due to the rules,

14
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,280
 I can move my king. Bp7 ends the video as I cannot take his bishop because that is not a revenge,

15
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,560
 but I have faith that my opponents won't be making such an obvious blunder. Right?

16
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:06,880
 My god that was close. And in this position, something unexpected happened. I got a power outage.

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:22,480
 Therefore...

18
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,060
 (upbeat music)

19
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,980
 (victorious music)
