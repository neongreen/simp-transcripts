1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 100 rated chess, but you can only take their most extended piece, or pawn.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,640
 So in other words, I can only take what is closest to my territory.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,480
 Very challenging. We get a 1 24 American.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,720
 H3. Ah ha, long time no see, the Clemens opening.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:27,680
 E5. I actually don't know anything about the Clemens opening, so it's actually pretty scary.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,280
 G3. Not very aggressive.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,600
 D5. I mean if I don't have to capture anything,

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,040
 I'm not breaking the rules, and the video can last longer.

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,240
 F3. Very aggressive, I guess he wants to prevent E4, but sadly.

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,520
 E4. F takes E4.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,360
 Bishop D6. I mean I actually cannot checkmate him because his E pawn is the most extended

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,280
 material right now, but he should be able to see, that taking my pawn is obviously blundering a

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:10,800
 checkmate in 1. Right? There we go. You see, always have faith in the 100 rated guys.

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:18,960
 I'll take this pawn. D3. Man I have a feeling that this guy is just randomly pushing his pawns here.

15
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,800
 Bishop takes G3 check. King E2.

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,760
 Bishop F5. King D2.

17
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,640
 Wow, it is very impressive to see a 100 rated guy seeing that he can move his king to unlock

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,440
 the way for his bishop to defend a pawn. But anyway, knight C6.

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,880
 Queen H5. Very aggressive.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,000
 Bishop G6, this is actually pretty problematic because now his queen is his most extended piece,

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,160
 so unless he blunders his queen, I cannot continue to attack his king.

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
 Well. That was very convenient.

23
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,840
 Okay so I believe there are a lot of people already typing "paid actor" in the comment,

24
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,120
 but please trust me, he's not a paid actor at all, because a paid actor would immediately

25
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,800
 resign after blundering his queen instead of offering a draw like this.

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,000
 Man, that was just a coincidence, and since the video is still so short,

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,400
 I'll answer some of your comments instead.

28
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,200
 You could've put this video "I am sometimes not better than my viewers".

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,120
 No, I disagree, I'm better than my viewers, and even if sometimes I lose,

30
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,040
 I'm still better than my viewers.

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,800
 Plot twist it actually wasn't a viewer.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,320
 Oh, that's right, that actually makes sense because he actually beats me in that game,

33
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:45,200
 and since I'm better than my viewers, it should've been me winning that game instead.

34
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,800
 So now I absolutely agree with you that he was actually just pretending to be my viewer.

35
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,360
 *quack*

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,560
 Just fork me please, simp 2022.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:03,040
 Well, actually, this video was produced and published on December 29th, 2021.

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:13,280

39
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,200
