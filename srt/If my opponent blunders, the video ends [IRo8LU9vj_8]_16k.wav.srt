1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 If my opponent blunders,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 the video ends.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,400
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,880
 Disclaimer.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,760
 I only use chess.com's engine to analyze the game after it is done, which means I don't cheat during the game.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,240
 I know everyone understands this,

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:27,760
 but I also know that some haters will just ignore it and say things like, "Oh you trash youtuber you use engine unsubbed."

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
 So I had to say it out.

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,780
 Well, of course we'll use chess.com's engine, aka

10
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:39,680
 Stockfish, to decide whether a move is a blunder or not.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,620
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:49,540
 We get a 100 rated from Vietnam.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:56,960
 Since I can't really know when will my opponent blunders, let's just play normally and hope for the best.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
 e4

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,680
 e5. Very standards. Knight f3.

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,840
 Knight c6.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,760
 Bishop c4.

18
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,760
 Things are going really well so far. Maybe I can finally have a completely normal chess game.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,840
 d5.

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,240
 Okay, that breaks the normal moves chain.

21
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,520
 And also, that blunders a pawn.

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,520
 But no,

23
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,120
 Stockfish says,

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,120
 it's a mistake.

25
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,820
 So it's like, it's a blunder, but it's not really a blunder, which means the video continues.

26
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,320
 Knight b4.

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,720
 Okay, there's no way that can be a good move.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,200
 But Stockfish, there's no way that is a blunder, right?

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,160
 Aha! Just an inaccuracy.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,360
 Knight c3.

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,160
 Bishop g4.

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,160
 That move looks okay, there's no need to check with Stockfish.

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,720
 I'll castle.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,160
 I know that castle is not a good move, but you know,

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,560
 the rules only mention about my opponent, so it doesn't matter even if I make a blunder, right?

36
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
 Knight f6.

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,320
 That move looks fine.

38
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,280
 Now I think the engine really wants me to go.

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,840
 Bishop b5 check.

40
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,120
 c6.

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
 d takes c6.

42
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,240
 Knight takes c6 and then I'll have a pinned knight.

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,440
 But no.

44
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,600
 A pin is related to tactics, and tactics can lead to blunders.

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,000
 Therefore,

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,760
 Rookie 1.

47
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
 Rookie 1.

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,740
 I know that's a bad move, but I'm just trying to keep my opponent from blundering things.

49
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:01,600
 Knight b takes d5.

50
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,440
 Okay.

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
 That blunders a lot.

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:13,200
 Now I have, knight takes d5, knight takes d5, rook takes e5 check, knight e7 blocking the check,

53
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:22,720
 bishop takes f7 check, king takes f7, knight g5 check, and then he will have to choose between going back down and give back the bishop,

54
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,040
 or going up and get checkmated.

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,680
 After those moves, I think I'll be up like two pawns and his king is stuck in the middle of the board.

56
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,080
 But of course, unless Stockfish thinks it's a blunder.

57
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,880
 Ha ha. There's no way my video can end.

58
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,840
 Going into the lines that I've just shown you guys is just too risky,

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,760
 since he is very likely going to blunder somewhere down the road.

60
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,840
 Therefore,

61
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
 d3.

62
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,880
 Knight takes c3. Nothing's wrong with that move. I'll take back.

63
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,760
 e4.

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,760
 That blunders a pawn.

65
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,080
 Not this way though.

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:18,160
 It's like, bishop takes f7, king takes f7, knight e5 check, king g8, knight takes g4.

67
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,980
 But again, let's see what Stockfish thinks.

68
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,440
 Yeah, it's just a mistake.

69
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,420
 And again, going into that bunch of tactics is too risky.

70
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,920
 Therefore, d takes e4.

71
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
 Knight takes.

72
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,000
 Okay, now that really looks like a blunder, since it's just blundered two pieces.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,440
 But of course, once again, I believe Stockfish is with me.

74
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,560
 Oh well.

75
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,560
 What the f-
