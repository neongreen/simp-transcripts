1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 When your opponent's piece or pawn lands on a column, you must play a piece or a pawn on the same column.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 If you can't, the video ends.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Playing 3-minute splits on a 100-rated account.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Well, I normally don't take challenges that is too long to read, because it will be hard to make a good video title.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 But again, I can't argue with money. Therefore, let's find an opponent.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 We get a 273 from the US.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 E4.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Ah ha! Now I have to move something on the E-file. And when I say something, I actually mean the pawn.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Basically, I only have 2 moves, E6, and E5.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 If I play E6, he will get to play E5, which forces King E7, which is bad.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 But still, let's also look at the other move.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 If I play E5, he will get to play Queen H5, which forces H6, and then Queen takes E5, which forces a King move,

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 and since the King can't move in that position, the video ends.

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Which even worse, is that after H6, he may go into play Bishop C4, which forces C6 or C5, blundering a scholar's mate.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 So of course, between moving the King up and getting checkmated, I'll choose E6.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Oh wait, there's still a chance that he's not going to play E5.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Nevermind. King E7 is forced.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 F4.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Very aggressive. That forces me to choose between F6 and F5.

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 If I play F6, E takes F6 forces a move from the F file, and since I don't have any, the video ends.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Therefore, F5.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Please don't know about en passant, and also please don't move your knight to F3.

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Thank god.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 D5.

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Can't just let him keep pushing his pawns towards my King.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Of course knight F3 ends the video now, but what else can I do? My moves depends on how he plays the game.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 C3.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 I'll develop my bishop. If a miracle happen and allows me to move my bishop to the F file, this video will at least last a bit longer.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 B4.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Very aggressive.

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Now I have the chance to develop my knight. But if I play knight C6 or knight A6, he may decide to play B5, which forces me to move my B pawn, which blunders a horsey.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 Also, if I play B6, he may also decide to push B5, which forces me to play knight C6 or knight A6, blundering my own horsey.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Therefore, B5.

34
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 *pop*

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Well, I kinda saw that was coming, so there's no what the f*ck today.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 *outro music*
