1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
 I'm better than my viewers, the Ottomans capturing your city, Constantinople.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:12,460
 This is an image of Constantinople, aka Istanbul, a major city of Turkey, and I guess this guy

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,920
 thinks these Poles are rooks.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,400
 But anyway, gentlemen and ladies, welcome to another I'm better than my viewers video,

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,600
 the series that I made so that I can destroy my viewers that are literally making money

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,600
 for me by watching my videos, and the viewer this time is a guy called Zed.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,320
 I'll take this rook.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,040
 Making room for this passive knight to be developed to a more active square.

9
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,320
 Rook takes.

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,280
 Knight g4.

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,460
 Queen e7.

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:47,320
 He has like 300 rooks and still decided to move his queen, which is to say, very aggressive.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,800
 I'll take this rook.

14
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,120
 Rook takes knight b4.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
 Rook cd5.

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,940
 Ah ha, so instead of keeping the queen on the d-file and moving the rook to the e-file,

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,200
 he decided to move his queen to the e-file, and then move another rook to the d-file.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
 c4.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,680
 Ha, he even replaced his queen's position with that rook.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,560
 Knight fe3.

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,120
 Rook takes g4.

22
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,200
 That sacrifices a rook.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,520
 And I mean if he can also sacrifice the rook on the other side, that will be very convenient.

24
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,120
 Well, I mean convenient things sometimes do happen in our lives.

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,960
 I'll take it.

26
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,740
 Rook a b8.

27
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,820
 Bishop takes f5.

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,560
 Rook sacrifice again.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,600
 I'll take with pawn.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,240
 Rook takes b4.

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,040
 Knight c3.

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,640
 Rook hd6.

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,240
 Knight e4.

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,200
 Attacking the rook and defending the d-pawn at the same time.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,520
 Rook a d7.

36
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,520
 Too many attackers, so even though I really don't want to do this, d3.

37
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,880
 I mean this move really locks down my knight's activity, but it's still better than bishop

38
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,240
 c3 allowing rook a4 b8 or rook b1 infiltrating my territory.

39
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,720
 Rook a b6.

40
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,160
 No more threat on the a-file, bishop takes rook takes bishop c3.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
 This rook.

42
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
 Is trapped.

43
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,240
 A desperado.

44
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,640
 Knight takes, rook revenges queen takes.

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,060
 Rook b8.

46
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,840
 Queen retreats.

47
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,200
 Rook b7.

48
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
 d5.

49
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,560
 He seems eager to attack my king, so as long as I can keep this knight here to go back

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,440
 and defend my king, I will definitely be fine.

51
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:37,120
 Rook check knight blocks rook d5 f4 queen d7 a lot of batteries aiming at a protected

52
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,040
 pawn knight d2 rook back bishop takes queen takes very convenient bishop takes rook takes.

53
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,120
 And I guess we all know that I can easily win the game from this position even against

54
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,640
 magnum carlos.

55
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,040
 So fast forward a little bit.

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,720
 Queen takes a8.

57
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,800
 Checkmate.

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
 I'm better than my viewers.

59
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:09,360
