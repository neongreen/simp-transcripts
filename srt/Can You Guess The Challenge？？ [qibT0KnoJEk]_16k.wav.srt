1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge after 6 moves.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:12,560
 Ha, I would be worried if it was 2 or 3, but 6 is like a free win for me. We get a 1 25 from the UK.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:16,480
 E3. Not very aggressive.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,760
 E5. 1 move is out, 5 more until the challenge begins.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,960
 Queen F3. So I think the best plan should be to get as many pieces out as possible before

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:38,160
 the challenge begins, therefore, bishop C5. Bishop C4. Knight F6, I mean it will be a little bit

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,000
 disturbing if he decides to sacrifice his bishop just to make me waste a move on my useless king.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,880
 But who plays like that anyway? Right? Of course. D5. Bishop E3. Normally I would like to play E4

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,640
 here against the 100 rated players, but since I only have 2 free moves left, it's better to

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,480
 develop a bishop. Well but I mean if he really blunders his queen here, I'm down to spend a

11
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:14,240
 precious move to make the capture. Of course that doesn't happen. Only 1 move left, I have to move

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,720
 my queen. E4. Very aggressive. 6 moves are already over. Let's reveal the challenge.

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,080
 All pieces, or pawns, you have moved have to stay in those positions.

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:41,680
 Knight C6. It's fine, I don't need those useless things. He takes a useless unable to move pawn.

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,800
 Knight D4. I will destroy his position using only this horsey.

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:02:00,080
 C3. Knight F5. Please blunder your queen. Thank you. Knight takes G3. Ha, now please take this

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:06,640
 immobilized bishop and immobilized queen and leave my movable knight aside. Or you can take that

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,920
 pawn, also works. Long castle. You may be wondering why didn't I take this rook and save my knight

19
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,920
 first? Well, I still believe that he's gonna take my queen now instead of my knight and open up this

20
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:29,120
 file for a potential checkmate. Absolutely. Rook HE8 check. I mean checkmating him right now is

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,960
 still a very challenging task as I cannot move any of these pieces, for example even if he blocks

22
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,800
 with the knight and blunder a checkmate in 4 of rook E2 king D1 rook B2 discovered check F3.

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,360
 I still have to take that pawn with this bishop, which is not allowed by the rules.

24
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:54,080
 But who cares anyway. King D2. Now I have to take this rook. It's fine. No need to rush,

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,320
 and who knows maybe he'll go knight E2 giving away a free knight and a free king.

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:07,040
 That blunders a king. Rook takes E2 check. Well I mean king D3 getting into a very easy to see

27
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,000
 checkmate in 5 is still very problematic as I cannot move my light square bishop,

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
 but maybe he'll decide to go down instead.

29
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:34,880
 Very convenient. Knight takes F2. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

30
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,460
 (upbeat music)

31
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,900
