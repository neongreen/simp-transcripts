1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 100 rated chess, but you can only move diagonally.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Knights are fine.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Also, I cannot make any sacrifices.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Because if I just let my knights die to open up the way for the other pieces,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 the mission may become a bit too easy.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And with that out of the way, let's start the game.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 We get a 257 from the US.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 E4.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Well, I don't have many choices anyway.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Knight C6.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 D4.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Very aggressive.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Knight F6.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 E5.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Again, very aggressive.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Leaving the knight to death can open up the way for my queen and bishop to move,

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 but of course, that is against the rules.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Therefore, knight back to G8.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Bishop B5.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Very aggressive.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 But actually, if he takes my knight with his bishop,

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 I can open up the way for my bishop to go out.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Therefore, knight H6.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Bishop takes C6.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 That should be good.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 But the question is, which way should I take his bishop?

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 If I take it with my B-pawn, then after bishop A6,

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 a simple move like B3 will absolutely kill my bishop's activity.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 But if I go with my D-pawn, my king will be exposed to more danger,

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 because my queen is still not able to move yet.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Alright. I think I need to take the risk.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 D takes C6.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Because not only do I open up the way for my bishop,

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 my king can also join in the fun too.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 #KingsFunMatters

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 C4.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Man, this guy is really aggressive.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Bishop E6.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Knight A3.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Knight F5.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Bishop E3.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Ah ha! Very funny.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 He's basically telling me to go knight H4, G3, knight G to check,

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 king E2, knight takes E3, king takes E3 going for the hyper-bonk-cloud opening.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Well, if this were a normal game, I would do it for sure.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 But sadly, for this video, if I let my knight die like that,

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I will only have a bishop to play with.

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 And king.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Knight H6.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 D5.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 That blunders a pawn.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 C takes D5.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Bishop takes D5.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Of course queen takes D5 is winning a bishop since I cannot take back.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 But of course, no one plays like that. Right?

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 My god that scares me to death.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 But anyway.

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 That blunders a rook.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 But sadly, if I go for his rook,

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 queen takes D8 is actually forcing king takes D8,

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 which is not a diagonal move,

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 which makes me a fool for ending my own video.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Also, it looks like that he wants to go E6,

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 bishop takes H6, G takes H6, and queen takes H8.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Therefore, knight F5.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 It's actually pretty scary that my bishop is hard-pinned here in the middle of the board.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Queen A4 check.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Ah ha!

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Just as I was worrying about my bishop being pinned,

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 he unpinned it immediately.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 Bishop C6 is kinda forced.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Queen back to D1.

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Nope.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 No queen trade here.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Bishop D7.

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Queen D3.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Knight back to H6.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 I don't have many choices anyway.

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Long castle.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Ah!

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 This is becoming a bit scary.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Now queen takes D7 is ending the mission immediately.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 But since it's actually blundering a rook for bishop exchange,

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 let's just hope that he won't do it.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Knight F5 knight F3 knight H6 queen D5 knight F5 knight G5

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Oh wait wait wait.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Let's not blunder checkmate in 1.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Knight H6.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Knight E4.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 Knight F5 bishop G5 knight H6 bishop takes H6 G takes H6 and I win on time.

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Well, I guess everyone understands this,

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 but I still have to say it out,

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 that the times when I speed up the moves are the times when I was only repeating my moves,

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 and speeding up is to avoid the boringness in the video.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 But anyway.

96
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 Mission accomplished.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:29,000
