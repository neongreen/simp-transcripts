00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 100 rated chess, but you're a simp, if a piece, or pawn, can move into the sight of the opponent's

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,360
 queen to impress her, it has to. Trying so hard to impress a queen, is very impressive.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,760
 E4, the very obvious plan is to close down the center and not let him move his queen out,

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
 because as soon as his queen joins in the fun, this video is f***ed.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:33,120
 E6, aha, that opens up the queen's view this way, therefore, H4 is forced, everything is going

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:43,360
 according to plan. D5, opening up the board is very stupid, therefore, E5. Bishop D6, that blunders

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,480
 a bishop, and since E takes D6 also puts Edward into the queen's sight, E takes D6 is forced,

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,920
 it's actually pretty sad that even though Edward is trying very hard to impress the enemy queen,

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,040
 he'll have to die next move. Edward is dead, D4 is the best move now, but that will force bishop

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:12,960
 G5 impressing his queen next move, which is not very impressive, therefore, B3. Knight F6, aha,

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,720
 bishop B2, the plan is to trade with his knight before my bishop gets swallowed by his queen,

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,080
 so as long as he doesn't move his knight away now, the mission should be very easy from now on.

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:32,080
 That is not very convenient. Bishop F6 is forced. Please take with your knight or pawn.

14
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:41,840
 Thank you. C4 castle knight C3 knight C6 E takes D5 E takes D5 D4. Well I mean at least I still

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,600
 have a center pawn to control the dark squares to replace the dead bishop. Wow! That blunders a

16
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,760
 horsey, but if I take it, my queen will be forced to go queen F6 or queen B6 next move to impress

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:02,880
 his queen, which blunders a woman. So I guess, knight F3, I'm down to take with pawn next move.

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:11,520
 Knight E4. That blunders the knight again in 2 different ways, but sadly, knight G5 is forced.

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:19,440
 How come a horsey also wants to impress a woman though? Knight takes G5. H takes G5,

20
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,120
 okay now if he takes that pawn, I'll go queen H5 and then we can trade queens and this mission is

21
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,560
 a success, but since my queen is still attacking his knight, I guess he'll just move his knight

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,800
 back now. Or he can just not take the pawn and not retreat the knight at the same time and just very

23
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,000
 casually push a flank pawn 2 squares forward. Bishop D3. I'm threatening bishop H7 king H8

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,520
 bishop G6 king G8 rook H8 king H8 queen H5 king G8 queen H7 a very textbook checkmate in 5.

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:03:01,120
 So in no world he cannot see it. Right? Yeah, he saw it. Since he developed all of his minor pieces,

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,600
 the next thing to come is obviously his queen, which is not very good for this video.

27
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,880
 Therefore, let's take a risk. Queen H5, okay I know a lot of people are very mad right now

28
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,720
 because this is just blandly blundering a bishop, but based on my experience against the 100 rated

29
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,240
 players, they will just play G6 right now to attack my queen, which blunders a king, so I

30
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:32,960
 believe that this is a worthy risk to take. Ha! What an amazing unpaid not actor. Queen takes H7,

31
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,880
 checkmate. Mission accomplished.

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:51,700
