1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 100 rated chess.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 But I play atomic chess.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 For those of you who don't know about atomic chess,

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 it's actually very simple.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 If a capture happens,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 every pieces around that capture

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 dies,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 except for the pawns.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 So pawns are like

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 cockroaches.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 In an atomic explosion,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 the humans die,

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 like cockroaches live.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Except,

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 if a pawn captures something,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 it dies too,

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 because the explosion is too strong in its center.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 And yes,

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 you're right.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 A piece, or a pawn,

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 can only capture

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 once.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Just like condoms,

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 you only use those once.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And with that out of the way,

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 let's find an opponent.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 We get a 6-63 from Vietnam.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Oh no.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 This is going to be boring,

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 since my opponent is actually a little bit too high rated.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 But anyway.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 E4.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 D5.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Ah ha.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Just as I was trying to do a mission that is related to capturing,

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 he gave me a capture from move 1.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Alright then.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 E takes D5.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 According to the atomic chess rules,

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 this pawn is also dead.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Like, I can still see it right there,

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 but I will pretend that it's not there,

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 and will never move it,

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 even if he doesn't take it.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Qd5.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Well, I should have said it as Qxd5,

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 but since I'm pretending that my pawn was already dead to the atomic explosion,

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 I have to say it as

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Qd5.

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Therefore,

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 very aggressive.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 He puts his queen in the middle of the board for no reason at all,

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 because there was no pawn on D5 for him to capture,

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 and yet he still put it there.

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Nc3.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Of course Qxd2 explodes the king away,

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 which ends this video.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 But let's be real.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 There's no way he's going to do that.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Right?

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Qe6 check.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Be2.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Of course Qxe2 also explodes the king,

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 but there's no way a 600-rated player is going to do that.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Right?

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 c5.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Very aggressive.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Nf3.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Bd7.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Ah ha!

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 He follows up a very aggressive move,

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 with a not very aggressive move,

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 which makes him

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 neutral.

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 K.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 a6.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Again,

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 not very aggressive.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Rhe1.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Bb5.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 That blunders a queen.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Bxb5,

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 not check,

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 because,

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 according to the atomic rules,

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 my bishop is now dead.

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 So even though the game is actually making my bishop checking his king,

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 it's actually not.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 A pawn moves diagonally to b5.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Well,

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I should have said that as

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 a takes b5.

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 But since I'm pretending that there was no bishop on b5,

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 I have to say it as

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 a pawn magically moved from a6 to b5.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 But anyway,

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 rook takes e6.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And once again,

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 even if he doesn't take the rook back,

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 I will still consider it

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 dead.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 And he resigned.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Mission

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 accomplished.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:51,000
