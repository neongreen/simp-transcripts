 100 rated chess, but the number of reactions is how much distance you must travel this game.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:17,120
 17 plus 6 is 23. 33 41 50 56 63 71 78 84 90 95 100 103.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,640
 Which is a lot. We get a 204 from India.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,440
 And I didn't know that you can take a selfie inside a prison.

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,000
 E4. The furthest I can possibly go in my first move, is 2 squares.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,640
 E5. The piece that can move the most freely is obviously my queen.

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,480
 I'll open the way for the woman. Perfect. Queen takes D4.

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,600
 Knight C6. Pulling her back is not a very good option. Queen sideway.

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,320
 Queen F6. I really want to move my queen again to cover more squares,

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,360
 but since there are not many safe squares left for her.

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,640
 Knight F3. According to the Pythagoras theorem, my knight traveled a distance of square root of 2

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:18,080
 squared plus 1 squared. Which is square root of 5, so I'll add 2.236 into my counter.

13
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:27,840
 Bishop C5. Bishop G5. Before you jump down to the comment below and say that I'm a noob.

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,560
 Please listen to me. You see, a few thousand years ago,

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,960
 God made a mistake to let Adam meet his maiden. When they are both f***ed.

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,600
 Man I also wish I can meet a new woman when we're both f***ed. Such an amazing scenario.

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,920
 But anyway, my point is that even God can make mistakes, so the fact that I made a mistake of

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:02:00,320
 blundering my rook is totally acceptable. Ha! A random guy once said. If your enemy

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,200
 doesn't spot your mistake, then you didn't make any. But anyway. That blunders a woman,

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,160
 but I don't want to spend a turn on a 1.4 length of movement. So I guess.

21
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
 What the f***?

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:33,520
