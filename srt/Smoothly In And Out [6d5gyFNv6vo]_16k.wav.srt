00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 100 rated chess, but your pieces, and pawns, must always go back to their original position

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,440
 after every move. Oh, wait.

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:19,040
 My bad. But anyway, this sounds absolutely impossible, but of course, a real man never

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:26,480
 backs down from difficulties. E4, the pawns are not affected by this challenge, so just like usual,

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:38,560
 I'll make sure to use them to their maximum limits. E5. Still theory. D4. D5. Aha, now D takes E5 is

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:45,040
 obviously the best move, but after D takes E4, our queens will be looking at each other, and if I take

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,480
 his queen, king takes will end the video because I cannot move my queen back after she's dead,

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,200
 and I also don't like to wait for him to take and then go king D1 king E1, therefore, I'll take this

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:07,600
 way instead. E takes D4. Okay. Here we go. Queen takes D4. Okay now queen back to D1 is forced next

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,920
 move, so if he goes bishop B4 check now, it will prevent me from going queen D1, but since that is

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,960
 obviously blundering a bishop, he's not going to play that move. Right? Of course. Queen D1 is

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,560
 forced. I mean queen E7 is also a big problem because if I block with a piece, I cannot move

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,520
 that piece back in my next move, but since he probably wants to keep his queen's pressure on

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:41,920
 my pawn, I think we don't need to worry too much about that. B6. Aha, that blunders a horsey to

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,040
 bishop B5 check bishop D7 bishop takes A6, but sadly, bishop B5 needs to be followed by bishop

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,240
 back to F1, which means he is actually not blundering his horsey. A3. I'm calculating bishop

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,400
 B7 C4 and then he'll have bishop B4 check which is very likely ending my video because I'll have

18
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,080
 to block with a piece or move my king, so A3 is a preemptive move to prevent bishop B4.

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:16,560
 Exactly as planned. C4. Well I mean if he still decides to take my pawn and give me a free piece,

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:26,400
 that will be very convenient. I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. C takes D5.

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,680
 Okay I mean now my bishop is very obviously attacking his knight, so after he moves his

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,640
 knight away from the attack, you will finally believe that he's not a paid actor. Are you

23
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,360
 serious? I'll take the knight. In no world do you go B5 just to block my bishop from going back.

24
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,480
 What the f-

25
00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:07,040
