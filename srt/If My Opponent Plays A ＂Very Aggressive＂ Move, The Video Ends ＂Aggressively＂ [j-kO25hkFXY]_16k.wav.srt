1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 If my opponent plays a very aggressive move,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 the video ends aggressively,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Well, maybe you are wondering,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 when do we consider a move as an aggressive one?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 No worries, because I will be the judge of that.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 If I think a move is very aggressive,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 then it is very aggressive,

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 and if I don't, then it's not.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Very simple.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And with that out of the way,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 let's find an opponent.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 We get a 174 from Australia.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Ok, first move.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I think in order to prevent my opponent from playing aggressively,

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 I need to play even more aggressively.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 E4.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 E5.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Nothing special so far.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Knight f3.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Bishop c5.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 That is a gambit.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And gambits can be considered as aggressive openings.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 But still, I don't think this is too aggressive.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 You know, like, it's kinda aggressive,

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 but not too aggressive, that makes me end my video.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Therefore, knight takes e5.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Accepting a gambit is an aggressive play,

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 but of course, this challenge only affects my opponent,

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 so it doesn't matter how crazy my play is.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Queen f6.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Very aggressive.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 No.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I mean it looks kinda aggressive,

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 but it's not too aggressive.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I mean if he really wants to play aggressively,

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 he can just play queen h4,

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 forking my e-pawn and my f-pawn.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 But instead, he chose queen f6,

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 which allows knight f3,

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 going back to safety.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And also keeps his queen from getting into too much trouble in the future.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 So in conclusion,

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I think that,

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 he played aggressively,

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 but he also didn't want to play too aggressively.

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Which means,

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 the video,

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 survived.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 d4.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 This move is really aggressive,

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 but again,

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 who cares how I play anyway.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 And the best thing is,

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 in this position,

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 he doesn't have any aggressive moves at all.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Well,

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 I mean he does have things like bishop takes d4,

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 or even queen takes f2 going absolutely crazy.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 What the f

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 What the f

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 What the f

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 What the f

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 What the f

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 What the f

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 What the f

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 What the f
