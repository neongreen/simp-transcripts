00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 100 rated chess, but pawn lives are sacred. No pawn can be harmed during the filming of this video.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,360
 An extremely difficult to the point of impossible challenge, but since this specific guy has

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,000
 donated me a lot of money, I'll do it this time. We get a 100 rated guy from France.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,560
 Fun fact, I played a lot of chess in July, but don't remember seeing any French opponents,

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,520
 so this guy is probably the first one after a month. G3. Of course in no world I'm pushing

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,520
 my center pawns, but he will. Bishop G2. Another pawn push will give me a bunch of headache,

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,920
 but he should be able to see, that my bishop is aiming at his weak B7 pawn,

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,880
 so it would be better to keep his D pawn defending his rook. Right?

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:04,240
 Ha! He's even more careful than I thought. B3. Queen C7. I don't know what that move does,

10
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:13,440
 but no threat anyway. Queen E5 bishop E5 expected. Didn't happen. That blunders a pawn,

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,800
 but the rule is against me, knight F3. C4 will be a bit problematic, but as it hasn't happened yet,

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:30,000
 it'd be better to just ignore it for now. D4. Knight A3. More control over C4 to prevent it

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,680
 from happening, and furthermore, I actually have a secret plan with this sneaky horsey.

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,880
 Queen C6. He's pinning my knight into my bishop, which is very dangerous,

15
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:52,480
 so I'll unpin myself first. Knight F6. Knight E5. Since I cannot take his pawns,

16
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:57,840
 the plan is very simple. I win his woman, he resigns, game over.

17
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:06,000
 Exactly as planned. You see, when I played knight A3 a couple of moves ago,

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,400
 I have already calculated that his queen will move from C7 to C6 to B5 and die to my horsey,

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:26,240
 knight takes B5. Restoration. Mission accomplished.

20
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:33,580
