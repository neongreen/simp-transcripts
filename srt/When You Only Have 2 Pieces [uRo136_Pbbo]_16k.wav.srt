00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 100 rated chess, but it's freezing, pieces and pawns which are unmoved for 5 turns.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,880
 Die. You won't believe how much time it took me to read the above text, but of course,

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,720
 still much shorter than the time you've been made unless. We get a 167 from the Philippines.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,600
 E4. This challenge is actually very difficult as my amount of possible usable material is

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,280
 very limited depending on how many things I can move out in the first 5 moves, so the first move

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:40,800
 is obviously, E5. Opening up the lines for pieces to come out in the next 4 moves. Knight F3. Ah ha,

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,680
 defending that pawn is an option, but I'll go for, bishop C5. I'm gambiting this pawn so that

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,120
 he won't be able to develop too many things against my limited size army, and in no world

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:01,040
 do you attack my bishop right now to force me to waste a move to save it. F***. I'll take that pawn.

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,640
 I mean even if he takes with queen right now, I don't know if I even want to spend a move to take

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:16,240
 her. Thank you. I'll develop my queen. Well, at least now he doesn't have any ways to attack my

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:25,040
 queen and make me waste another move. Nevermind. What is wrong with this guy? I'll take that pawn.

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,440
 So now instead of having 4 pieces, I only have 2, the rest are all dead according to the rules,

14
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,360
 and in no world do you block with your queen here that blunders a horsey.

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:46,480
 Well, I mean that also blunders a horsey, but it's good for me. F3. That blunders a pawn,

16
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,920
 but of course I'm not gonna do that. The only thing I can think of now is to pray for some

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:04,240
 luck at an early checkmate. G3. Queen C5. Please don't see anything. Knight C3. Okay. Here we go.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:13,520
 Queen F2 check. King D2 is forced. Alright, now I have 2 choices, continue to check with the queen

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,480
 and get a draw by repetition, or check with the bishop and hope that something greater will happen

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:28,160
 with a bigger risk of losing this challenge. You know what? I'm not a coward. King D3 is forced.

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,000
 Bishop back to B6. I mean if he goes back to D2, maybe I'll really have to think about a repetition,

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,480
 but if he goes to C4, I'll resign this game to none of this giga-chat.

23
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,400
 Ha! Coward. That blunders a king.

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,080
 Mission accomplished.

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:07,040
