00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
 100 rated chess, but you do not let your opponent enters your half of the board.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,640
 And I think we can all agree, that he meant pieces and pawns.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:18,560
 Very aggressive. We get a 139 from Argentina. First of all, I just want to say that I think

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,920
 this challenge is very difficult. Therefore, let's get serious right from move 1. E4 will provoke him

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,400
 to play E5, which will open up the way for bishop B4 and queen H4 ending the video, and of course I

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,120
 cannot prevent both of them, because even if I play A3 instead of E4, E5 will still be very likely

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,280
 to happen, and then there are still E4 and queen H4 at the same time, which is also unstoppable.

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:54,560
 Therefore, D4, D4 will provoke D5 to happen, and that move only allows bishop G4 to end the video,

9
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:04,960
 which is very easy to prevent. There we go. Bishop G4 is the threat, therefore, F3, I mean H3 looks

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:13,600
 more natural, but F3 will further prevent knight F6 and knight E4 in the future. Knight C6. Knight

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:22,240
 B4 is the threat, so of course, C3. Ha! Believe it or not, I actually prepared all of this before

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:31,360
 the game begins. Okay, that move was not in my preparations, therefore, it gets serious now.

13
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,280
 DxE4 is kinda forced. Of course I cannot let that pawn end my video, and even though there is queen

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:49,760
 H4 is available, I mean who develops their queen first anyway. Right? Of course. 2 threats now,

15
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,120
 so I have to choose one. I mean who plays a weird move like knight C4 anyway.

16
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:09,520
 Perfect. B3. Ha! The video is safe. G5. Very aggressive. G4 is obviously the threat,

17
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:21,520
 but sadly, that pawn dies now. H5. Again, very, aggressive. Queen D4. I mean H4 is a threat,

18
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,640
 but since I'm attacking his knight, he can't just move a pawn like that. Right?

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:35,440
 Bishop E6. That blunders a horsey. Yeah, now I'm really threatening to take another horsey

20
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:47,280
 with a family fork, so in no world do you end my video now. To be honest, I think I deserve that.

21
00:02:47,280 --> 00:03:02,080
