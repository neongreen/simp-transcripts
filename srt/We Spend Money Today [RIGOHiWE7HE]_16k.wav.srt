00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 100 rated chess, the movie, before you win, you must prove your opponent is a paid actor.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,160
 Ha! Too easy, we get a 2 0 7 paid actor from Indonesia.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,840
 E4. Since I already paid him and told him to play like a paid actor,

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,160
 the only plan we have today is to win the game within the first 15 moves.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,480
 D5. Ah ha, fun fact, I actually told him to play the Scandinavian defense myself.

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'll take that ball. Queen takes. Knight c3. Most of the normal 100 rated players are just gonna

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,880
 blunder their queen right now in some way or another, but I actually told my opponent not

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,080
 to blunder their queen too early into the game, so he'll just gonna pull her back right now.

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:01:02,400
 Just as planned. Bishop c4. F5. Ah ha, I also told him to play really aggressive,

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:14,800
 therefore, very aggressive. Knight f3. E6. Not very aggressive. D4. Knight f6. Ah ha,

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,080
 I also told him to let me pin one of his knights, and since I've just append up my dark square

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,680
 bishop, he let me pin his knight right away. Knight c6. D5. I also told him that he should

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,840
 not blunder his pieces in the first 7 moves of the game, now is move 8, so a blunder should happen at

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:46,880
 any.. moment.. now.. that blunders a horsey. E takes d5. Bishop takes d5. Knight takes d5. Ah ha,

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,040
 he chose to blunder his queen because we're almost at move 15, therefore, I'll take it.

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,480
 A resignation is coming at any moment now. King takes. I'll take this knight as well. Or even

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:07,600
 better, instead of resigning, I guess he'll go king e8 allowing queen e5 bishop e7 queen e7 checkmate.

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:16,240
 Well, a win is a win, and since all of you have believed that I paid this guy to play against me,

19
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,960
 mission accomplished, and even though I should be answering some of your questions now,

20
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,080
 none of my viewers are my paid actors, so I actually cannot do that in this video.
