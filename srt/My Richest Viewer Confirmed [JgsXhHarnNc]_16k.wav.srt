 100 rated chess, but it's a sponsored video. I will pay you $1 for every point of material you

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,240
 capture from your opponent before the game ends. Every point of material you lose will deduct $1

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:21,920
 from your pay. Extra $25 if you checkmate with a pawn, extra $5 if you play bonk loud. $1,000 total.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,560
 Here I come. We get a 139 from the US. And to reduce the chance that my opponent decides to

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,000
 resign early into the game, I change the time control to 10 minute instead of the usual 5.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 And I'm not a coward. E4. Logically speaking, I should have played E4 to get into a more positional

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,160
 opening to avoid losing too many materials, but since I'll get another $5 playing bonk loud,

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:58,080
 E4 is actually a must. D6. Not very aggressive. Here we go. King E2 is f***ing forced.

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:09,760
 Plus 5 baby. Bishop G4 check. Very aggressive. F3. Bishop E6. Okay I know most of you guys are

10
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,480
 gonna hate this move, but king back to E1. To be fair, I'm just making way for bishop to go out,

11
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:26,240
 and I'm definitely not a coward. Bishop D7. This guy is obviously a pacifist. D4. Somehow I feel

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,600
 like he's gonna blunder his bishop right now. Well, I mean it's fair to say that he's not a

13
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,760
 paid actor, because my paid actor would have done a better job at hiding his identity. Bishop takes

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:50,720
 B5. C6. Bishop A4 B5 Bishop E3. Queen A5 check. Bishop blocks. I mean if he can also blunder his

15
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:59,840
 queen for free, that will be the easiest $9 of my entire life. Blue Cola. I'm sorry but I think you

16
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,120
 may have to pay a little bit more than you expected. Plus $9. But still, our biggest priority

17
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,520
 is to checkmate our opponent with a pawn for that whopping $25 bonus, and in order to do that, we can

18
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:23,520
 only hope that he won't resign the game too early. Bishop E7. Knight C3. Bishop H4 check. G3.

19
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:31,440
 Bishop G5. Now I'll take this pawn. It's going to be hard to win this bishop, so let's just ignore

20
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,360
 it for now and shift our focus toward the center. Nevermind. That's another $3. Someone must have

21
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,520
 paid this guy to play with me. H5. I'll take this pawn too. It seems like David is going to get us

22
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:57,040
 that sweet $25 bonus. Rook H6. Oh no no no no no no no. It seems like he wants to get rid of David,

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,600
 so even though my queen is obviously already defending it. Rook D1. Now David is very heavily

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:16,160
 defended. Well at least that is another $4. F6. Queen D8 is checkmate in one. But of course,

25
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:27,040
 I prefer $3. Bishop takes G8. He's a miss. Shut up Stockfish. G5. I feel like he's just gonna

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:34,240
 resign at any moment now, so let's not greed-taking all of these pieces. E5. Please don't take it.

27
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,200
 This guy blundered his entire board, but somehow still managed to take away all of those important

28
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:51,120
 pawns. Queen takes king move queen takes. Frank. Let's go. King E8 F4 king F8 F5 king E8 F6 king

29
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:58,960
 F8 bishop B4 C5 one free dollar king E8 and F7. Checkmate with a pawn. If my calculation is

30
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:04,640
 correct, that is $56 in total, but since this challenge is not a checkmate mission,

31
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,280
 there is no mission accomplished today.

32
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:21,600
