00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 I'm better than my viewers. Master vs Rookie. This looks absolutely horrible for white,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,760
 but I'm not a coward. Males females and gmales, welcome to another I'm better than my viewers

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,440
 video, and the viewer who's gonna lose to me today is a guy called grill master Cullen Rules.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,520
 Now I have 2 choices, retreat a queen and lose the other queen for free, or trade 2 queens for 2

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,920
 rooks. Losing a queen means losing 9 points of materials, trading 2 queens for 2 rooks means

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:40,000
 losing 8 points of materials. So I guess, I'll choose the latter. Rook takes E6. Let's give a

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,520
 check first. I mean who knows, maybe he'll think that this is checkmate because his king cannot

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,440
 move so I can get a free win and I can tell my viewers that he actually resigned. But of course

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,960
 that doesn't happen. I can retreat my queen now, but that will give him a free turn to take my F

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:06,640
 pawn. So I think I'll sacrifice her. Rookie takes F6. Knight F3. Defending my F pawn, and on second

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,160
 thought, maybe I should've taken this rook instead so I can defend my C pawn first as he wouldn't

12
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:23,120
 have the materials to attack my F pawn. Yeah. My bad. Knight C3. At least I'll try to cut off the

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:31,120
 rook's connection. Nevermind. Have to take that. Rook takes. It's actually pretty amazing that a

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,280
 900 rated guy can see that my pawn is pinned to my queen and rook D1 is also a checkmate in 1.

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:47,200
 Bishop A3. I don't know, just a random move to delay rook C1. Rook A4. Bishop takes rook takes.

16
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,680
 E3. Making room for my king to escape, but to be honest I don't think he can survive.

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,000
 Rook down rook takes rook takes. Bishop B5. I mean who knows, maybe he'll give me enough

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,680
 time to castle and move my queen out of danger. Sadly he's not a paid actor. And after a few

19
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,880
 moves more, I lost, but as usual, since I started from a worse position,

20
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,200
 I'm better than my viewers, but this guy, and only this guy, is equal to me.
