1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 100 rated chess. But I have to move my king, every time my opponent moves his queen.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Also, I cannot take his queen, because that will make it too easy.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 I actually got this idea from someone else, who commented on one of my videos.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 But sadly, I couldn't take a screenshot at that time. So now that comment is nowhere to be found.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Therefore, if you are the one who suggested this idea, please leave a comment below, with a link to your comment, or to the video that you commented in.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 I'll go check it out, and then pin your comment to return the favor.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 We get a 100 rated from India.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Ah ha! This is a lot of pressure on me.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 This mission actually resembles my name of simp.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 So if I fail to complete it, it will be the biggest humiliation towards my channel.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And yet, after such a long time, I finally get to see, an Indian opponent.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 And in case you don't know, I have never defeated an Indian before, and even worse, those videos ended,

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 very, quickly.

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Therefore, let's put some real focus into this game.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 E4.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Well, at least he cannot move his queen from move 1.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Right?

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 D5.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Ah ha! Very tricky.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Right at move number 1, we can already see the danger.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 If I take his pawn, queen takes d5 will force me to go king e2, and then queen to e4, is actually, a checkmate.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Therefore, no no no no no.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Knight f3.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 The Tennyson Gambit.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I think that this opening sucks, but who cares, since I'll most likely be going to push my king forward this game anyway.

27
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 D takes e4.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Knight g5.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Nothing too crazy so far.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And he went afk.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Mission, accomplished.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:57,000
