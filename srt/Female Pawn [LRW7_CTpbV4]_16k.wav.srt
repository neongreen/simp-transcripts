00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 100 rated chess, but your queen is having an identity crisis, she must move like a pawn,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,000
 until she reaches the back rank, then she can move normally. She must reach it before the game

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,120
 ends. Another very difficult challenge that can easily be disturbed by my opponent,

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:25,760
 but I'm not scared of it. We get a 1 17 from the Philippines. E4. So in order to push this pawn,

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,840
 I have to push this pawn. I'm sorry David, but you need to die so my queen can have the way to go

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,200
 forward. Or you don't have to. That blunders a bishop. This game is going very well very quickly.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:49,200
 Queen H5. Here we go. Queen D7. If you try to put a pawn on the 1st or 8th rank on chess.com,

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,960
 it will have to move 1 square first and then can go 2 squares,

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,880
 just like what I'm trying to do right now. Knight F3. I cannot go here yet. Knight F6.

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:09,600
 Knight E5. Ah ha, that blunders a horsey after knight H5 knight E7 bishop D7, but since I can

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,720
 not lose my queen in this video, queen D6 is kinda forced. On second thought, maybe pushing the queen

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:25,120
 on move 3 was too early of a decision. Queen takes F7 check. King D8 is forced. Please blunder

13
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:34,880
 something really bad. Yeah, like that. Rook takes F8. Ha, now all I have to do is to push my queen

14
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,880
 as fast as possible before he finally decides to resign the game. Knight C6 check. Taking his knight

15
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,680
 is going way too far with the material difference, king to E8. To be clear, I'm just trying to tackle

16
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,600
 the challenge in the most sensible way possible. And I'm not a coward. Knight B4. I mean that still

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:06,080
 blunders the horsey, but of course my queen doesn't move like that. Castle. A5. I need this knight to

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:16,960
 move somewhere else. That also works. Pawn push. Halfway done, halfway more. Rook E1. Now I have

19
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:28,000
 to take this knight. Please just don't resign. Thank you. Cd3 Cd3 knight F2 rook F1 pawn push.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,080
 I really need this knight to work with my queen, so he should be able to see, that rook takes F2

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,400
 is actually blundering a king to queen F2 king H1 is forced queen F1 a very textbook checkmate in 2.

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:50,400
 Right? Of course he does. My queen can go forward, but since a normal pawn cannot do that,

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,680
 I'll make the way first. Bishop E3. Wait. My queen is trapped.

24
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:07,760
 All right. Rook F1 check. Of course you're gonna take with the rook and be my unpaid actor. Right?

25
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:21,360
 So,

26
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,960
 uh,
