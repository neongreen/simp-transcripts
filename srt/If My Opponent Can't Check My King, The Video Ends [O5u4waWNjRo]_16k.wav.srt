1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
 If your opponent can't check your king,

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,500
 Not porn.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
 Oh, wait.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,500
 My bad.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,500
 If your opponent can't check your king,

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
 The video ends.

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,500
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
 Sounds easy.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 All I have to do, is to always allow a check, but not really allow a check.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,500
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

11
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:45,000
 We get a 135 from the US.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,500
 So it's kinda obvious that my opponent can never check me at move 1.

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,500
 Therefore, let's say, the challenge only starts at move, 3.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 E4.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,500
 Once again, this still doesn't count yet, because there is no other way.

16
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
 And I'm not a coward.

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,000
 E5.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Ah ha. Perfect.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 F4.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,500
 There you go.

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,000
 Even though I said the challenge starts at move 3,

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I already gave him a check at move 2.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 I'm such a generous man.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Nc6.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Nf3.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Even though I gave him a check, I still don't really like to be checked,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,500
 and since the challenge only requires that my king is always checkable,

28
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,000
 I think this is the safest way to continue the game.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,500
 Nf6.

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 Ah ha. He's trying to block his queen's check, which is a big threat to my video.

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
 Therefore, king e2.

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,000
 Now there's another check right here.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 The video, is safe.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 He takes f4.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Nc3.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,500
 Nothing too crazy so far, except for the fact that I'm playing Bonk loud.

37
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
 d6.

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
 Ah ha.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 He's trying to go Bg4, which looks like it pins my knight real hard to my king and queen.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 But guess what? That's actually good for me, since he'll have another potential check.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 So I guess, let's just ignore that.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 d4.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Bg4.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 I'll take a pawn.

45
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,500
 Qe7.

46
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,000
 Very aggressive.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,500
 But again, that's actually good for me, since he now has one more potential check.

48
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 Bg5.

49
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,500
 d5.

50
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,000
 Again, very, aggressive.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,500
 e5.

52
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,000
 I want to close down the center, which may sound stupid because I need him to attack my king,

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,500
 but since this guy is playing really aggressively, I don't think we have to worry about that.

54
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
 Nxd4.

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,000
 That blunders.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,500
 Wait.

57
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:45,500
 If I take his knight, there will be one less piece attacking my king, which leaves more room for the video to end.

58
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,000
 Nah.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,500
 I'm worrying too much.

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 That blunders a horsey.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 h6.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 I'll take.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,500
 gxh6.

64
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,000
 Alright.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,500
 Now I think we need to think again about taking this bishop.

66
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,000
 Well, who cares.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Qxg4.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,500
 As long as his queen is still alive, I think it's still fine.

69
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
 fxe5.

70
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
 Aha!

71
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,500
 Once again, he's trying to block his queen's check.

72
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
 Therefore,

73
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
 king back to e1.

74
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:39,500
 Now Qh4 is available, the video is once again safe.

75
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,500
 e4.

76
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,000
 That blunders a pawn.

77
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,500
 Now even if he goes exf3, I will still take his queen, because even though his queen is dead,

78
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:59,500
 his pawn on f3 will be the new check holder, not to mention about Bxc7.

79
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,500
 Opening Bh4+ and Bb4+.

80
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,500
 Qd6.

81
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,000
 Ah!

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 So he didn't blunder his queen, which should be even better for me.

83
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,000
 Qxc4+ check.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,500
 Oh, wait!

85
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,500
 He can't check me in this position.

86
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,500
 I'm so f***ing stupid!

87
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:41,500
 Thanks for watching!
