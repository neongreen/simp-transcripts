00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 100 rated chess, but any of your pieces, or pawns, who capture an enemy piece, or pawn,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:16,240
 become heroes. If a hero dies, the video ends. That's a pretty long challenge, but funny enough,

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:26,240
 very easy to understand. We get a 197 from the US. E4. E5. I personally think that this challenge

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:35,600
 is pretty easy, therefore, D4. Let's play a little bit more aggressively. Knight C6. Ah ha,

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,880
 he obviously wants me to take his pawn, which makes my pawn a hero, and then he'll take the

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:51,200
 hero, which ends the video. Therefore, D5. Bishop C5. That blunders a horsey, but if I take it,

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:58,480
 it will make my D pawn become a hero, and after he takes the hero, the video ends. So I guess,

8
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:10,160
 knight F3. Maybe this mission is not as easy as I thought. Knight D4. C3. Knight takes F3. Ah ha,

9
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,480
 that makes his knight a hero, but no one cares, and now that makes my queen my first hero,

10
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,640
 or you may say, heroine, which means I cannot let her die, in any circumstances.

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:32,800
 Queen F6. My queen must not die, therefore, queen E2. In no world do you go queen takes F2 now,

12
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:41,760
 or that. Wow. That blunders a bishop, but if I take it, queen takes will kill my heroine,

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:48,960
 which ends the video. So I guess, king D1. This guy is totally destroying me right now.

14
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,840
 D6. Ah ha, bishop D3. I mean if he can trade, the situation will become better for me.

15
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:08,400
 Perfect. Queen takes. Again, enemy's heroes are worthless. Bishop checks. Bishop blocks.

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:17,440
 Knight E7. Ah ha, that blunders a bishop, but do I even take it though, because after I take it,

17
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,560
 my bishop will become a hero, which means I will have another piece that I have to protect.

18
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,040
 You know what? It's fine, I mean he doesn't have many pieces left anyway.

19
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:40,160
 Castle. Knight D2. C6. Taking that pawn is obviously a bad decision. So I guess, rook F1.

20
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:48,640
 C takes D5. That blunders a queen, but since that makes my rook a hero, G takes will end the video.

21
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,160
 Therefore, queen G3. I mean it's just a woman anyway, no need to feel bad about missing it.

22
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,080
 Ha, and then he even brings it closer to the rook for us to take.

23
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,360
 This challenge is going very annoying very quickly. Rook takes will help him end the video,

24
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,000
 and my heroine's death will also end the video, therefore, queen H3 is kinda forced.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,600
 In no world do you take my hero bishop here. Of course, I'm pretty sure I'm the only person in

26
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:31,920
 the world feels good that my opponent doesn't blunder his queen. But anyway, knight F3. D takes

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:40,800
 E4. Aha! Finally! Now that really blunders a queen, now if he can just blunder his king as well,

28
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:48,800
 I would be very happy. And he does. I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor.

29
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:58,880
 Queen takes H7. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

30
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,460
 (upbeat music)

31
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,040

32
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,620
