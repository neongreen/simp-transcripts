00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 100 rated chess, but opening is important. You can only control the pieces, and pawns,

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,800
 that moved during the first 3 turns. This sounds absolutely impossible, but since I've been winning

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,840
 on a lot of challenges these days, it is time to take on some serious stuff. We get a 130 american,

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,720
 so I obviously want to play with my queen after the so-called opening, therefore, e4. And with

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:34,560
 that, Edward is the first guy that will join me in the middle of the game. e5. Queen h5, this is

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,680
 the famous wayward queen attack, and I mean even though things will be really bad if he attacks my

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,680
 queen now, but he should be able to see, that knight f6 is just blundering a pawn, and g6 is

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,200
 obviously blundering queen e5 check bishop blocks queen takes h8 winning a free rook. Right?

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,520
 Man. Now I have to move my queen, which means I will only be able to play with a warband and

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,760
 Edward from move 4, and even worse, now if I take this pawn, queen blocks is terrible because after

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,760
 I take his rook, queen takes e4 as a check, which forces me to end my own video. You know what?

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,040
 I'm not a coward, I mean there is always a chance that he won't block with his queen,

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,360
 and even if I had moved my queen back, there still wouldn't be many things for me to do

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:31,280
 with only a woman and a pawn, so I had to take this risk. Ha, amazing unpaid not actor.

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:41,120
 Queen takes h8. Bishop f6. Ah ha, that blunders a horsey, but if I take it, king e7 will start a

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,680
 fight between the women, and after queen h7, queen h8 will force a queen trade, which is absolutely

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,560
 not good for this video. Therefore, queen takes h7. Need to be careful on every single move.

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:04,480
 Bishop g5. Ah ha. Now I can take it. King e7 is forced, of course I'm not trading my woman.

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,560
 Queen g7. In no world do you take this pawn just to give a check and force me to end my own video.

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:25,120
 Why is he thinking for so long? Thank you. Queen h6. Queen f8. Queen f4. A resignation

21
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,440
 will be very convenient. Of course that doesn't happen, and in this position, I came up with an

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,880
 absolutely brilliant move that I'm sure even the great Magnus Carlsen will never be able to do the

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,240
 same in his games, so if you are interested, please feel free to pause the video right now

24
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:47,920
 to find that move, and unlike the other times, this time I will give you a couple of seconds to

25
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:58,320
 do that. Okay so normally I should be congratulating the people who found the move, but guess what,

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,640
 I'm actually sure that none of you were able to find it, and the move was...

27
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:15,840
 offering a draw. Game drawn by agreement, mission accomplished.

28
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:23,120
