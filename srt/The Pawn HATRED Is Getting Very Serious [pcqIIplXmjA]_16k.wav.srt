00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
 100 rated chess, but if the bishop sees a pawn, the video ends.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,800
 Another impossible challenge, but the truth is I'm really lacking ideas these days,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,960
 so I actually don't even have a choice. We get a 190 from turkey. I mean in the very

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,160
 starting position, the bishops are already looking at a lot of pawns. Therefore,

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,760
 let's change the challenge to, sees a different colored pawn. The video ends.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:37,920
 D4. Aha, now bishop F4 seeing my C pawn, or bishop G5 seeing my E pawn is ending the video.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,040
 Therefore, E5, I mean he can still play bishop F4 to end the video, but who plays like that anyway?

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:55,040
 Right? Of course, but now bishop E3 is also ending my video, and since there is actually no way to

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:02,320
 defend it, knight C6. If I attack his pawn, he has to defend his pawn, which means he can't end my

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:11,120
 video. There we go, and that move was also really good for me, because now I can go, bishop C5.

11
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,640
 My bishop now doesn't have to see his F pawn, and even though E3 ends the video now,

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:27,040
 who plays like that anyway? Right? That makes sense. F6. I'm provoking him to take my pawn,

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:35,280
 so that he won't play E3 or A3 to end the video. Perfect. Knight takes, since he saw I moved my

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:45,280
 knight, now he'll move his knight too. Man, I'm so good at reading these guys. Knight G4. Alright,

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,600
 now comes the problem. Now E3 should be the best move with the idea of sacrificing a pawn to save

16
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,040
 the king, but since sacrificing is not very natural, let's just hope that he'll play knight

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:05,840
 E4 defending the F2 square instead of E3 ending my video. Yeah, or not playing any of those moves.

18
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:14,880
 Bishop F2 check. King D2 is forced, queen E7. Oh no my horsey, and he should be able to see,

19
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:23,680
 that now E3 is blundering a king. Right? Of course. Another impossible challenge done.

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:41,440
 Queen to E3. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

21
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,100
 (upbeat music)
