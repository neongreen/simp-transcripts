1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,360
 If a piece, not pawn, moves from the king's side to the queen's side, the video ends.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,880
 Fine.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,920
 We get a 299 from the US.

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,380
 With diamond membership.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:20,080
 For those of you who don't know about the king's side and the queen's side of the chessboard,

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:27,320
 the king's side consists of the E, F, G, and H files, and the other 4 files, belong to

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,420
 the queen's side.

8
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,960
 So basically, if a piece, not pawn, moved from my left side to my right side, the video

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
 ends.

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
 E4.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,280
 Ah ha.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,480
 Now there are bishop D3, bishop C4, and bishop B5 ending the video.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,480
 But sadly, there is no way I can prevent all of them.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,760
 Therefore, D5.

15
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,740
 I want to at least stop bishop C4, and even though it looks like I'm just provoking bishop

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:06,040
 B5 check, most people will just take the pawn here.

17
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
 Knight C3.

18
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,040
 Ah ha, perfect.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,520
 D4.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,200
 If I attack his knight, he can't develop his bishop.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,320
 And once again, the challenge is only about moving from king's side to queen's side, not

22
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,520
 vice versa, so knight E2 doesn't end my video.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,280
 Knight B5.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,280
 Very aggressive.

25
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,280
 A6.

26
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,200
 Thanks to his aggressiveness, now I can prevent bishop B5.

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
 Knight A3.

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,520
 Bishop C4 is still a threat.

29
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,520
 B5.

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
 C3.

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
 Ha ha.

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,640
 D3.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,680
 Now he can't even end my video anymore.

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,220
 Man, I can't believe this challenge is going so smoothly.

35
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,960
 I thought I would have lost right away at move 2 or something.

36
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,160
 F4.

37
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,340
 Very aggressive.

38
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,400
 I can tell that my pawn push is making him really angry right now.

39
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
 E5.

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,560
 F takes E5.

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,440
 That blunders a rook.

42
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,440
 Queen H4.

43
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
 Check.

44
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,960
 G3 is forced.

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,600
 Queen takes E4.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,960
 Check.

47
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,400
 King F2.

48
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,880
 Queen takes A. Oh wait wait wait.

49
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,440
 If I take his rook, my queen won't be guarding my D pawn anymore, which allows bishop takes

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,620
 D3, which ends the video.

51
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:45,880
 But actually, I was playing those moves so fast, that I didn't even see, bishop C5 is

52
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,080
 a checkmate in 1.

53
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,800
 And it breaks the challenge's rule.

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,400
 Well, I mean, we have been in this situation many times, and you know what I always do.

55
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,320
 F*** the mission.

56
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,440
 Bishop C5.

57
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,400
 Checkmate.

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:19,840
 And since I failed the challenge myself, there is no what the f*** today.

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,420
 (upbeat music)

60
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,420
 you
