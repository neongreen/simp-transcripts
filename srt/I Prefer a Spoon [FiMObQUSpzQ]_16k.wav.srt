 100 rated chess, but you enjoy stabbing people? You can only capture through forks, skewers, and pins.

 Disclaimer, I have never stabbed any human being and also don't have a plan on stabbing anyone in

 the future. This video is only for entertainment purpose and has no connection to real life

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:30,560
 incidences. Let's go. We get a 100 rated guy from Poland. E4. E5. D3. Not very aggressive.

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,200
 And to fight a not very aggressive move, I have to play aggressively.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,760
 E takes D5. And I've just realized that I actually blundered a pawn because my

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,240
 queen cannot take back as she doesn't have any forks skewers or pins right now.

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:59,040
 Bishop C5. F4. Very aggressive. Queen F6. The plan is very simple. F takes E5, I stab him.

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:07,360
 Didn't work. But that creates a very good chance for a pin. Ha! Now the challenge is kicking in.

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:17,040
 C4. The pin is the only place I can make progress. Therefore, knight E7. Knight F5 to D4 E2 is the

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,200
 plan. D4. Ah ha! I really want to take it with my bishop, but since my bishop doesn't have any

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,840
 forks skewers or pins, and my E pawn has a 4. I can only take with pawn. B3. That blunders a rook.

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,120
 D3. Discovered attack on the rook, and then I realize my queen cannot capture because there

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:49,120
 is no stabbing method here. Ha! Nevermind, that knight was pinned to the queen, so as the challenge

15
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:57,360
 suggested, the piece after the pin can be taken. King takes. Knight F5. I'm trying to trick him to

16
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,160
 take my knight so that my queen will have a fork, which allows me to take his rook. Or he can also

17
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:13,280
 move his knight to the edge of the board. Center board. Bishop D2. Knight E3 check. Same tactic

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,520
 again, if he takes my knight, my queen has a fork, I take his rook he takes my bishop my queen has a

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:29,840
 fork again and takes his knight. Nevermind. Now that really blunders the rook. Ha! Fork. King D1.

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,960
 Knight takes A1. I can't believe I still haven't managed to checkmate him yet.

21
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:43,200
 H4. Tips for the beginners out there, when your king is in danger, please don't push a flank pawn.

22
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:53,680
 Queen B2. Knight C3. Ah ha! That blunders a very easy to see checkmate in 14, but in this position,

23
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:01,360
 something unexpected happened. You have been disconnected. Please, refresh the page to reconnect.
