1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
 Okay. Draw. I have absolutely no idea how this can be a draw, but let's try it out anyway.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,200
 Welcome to episode 7 of I'm Better Than My Viewers, and the challenger this time is a guy

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,720
 called Sylvia. As you can see, Stockfish is saying that White has a big advantage,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,200
 but since Stockfish hates me, I'm not gonna believe that. But anyway, these pawns are gonna

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,880
 change their gender really soon, therefore, let's spring more pieces into the defense.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:39,440
 And wow, a blunder on move 1, who would have thought. G-pawn changes gender. Queen cf1.

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,920
 More pieces into the defense. G2. Bishop d3. Since I only have to fight against pawns,

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,280
 bishops and queens are basically the same. Another G-pawn changes gender. I'll take with queen.

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:04,880
 G3. Ah ha, it's time to take the risk and turn the table. Queen takes h3, I mean G2 should be

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,880
 the best move now, but it is also very difficult to see because it hangs the f3-pawn, and he

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:19,040
 immediately found it. Wow. Alright, I'll take this pawn, I mean what else can I do anyway.

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:26,160
 Ha! Nevermind, I think that is the wrong move because that queen was supposed to help the

13
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:34,000
 h-pawn to change gender, but now, there is queen takes b1, now after another G-pawn changes gender,

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,960
 it's just the same thing as the beginning of the game. There we go. Queen f1 again. G4. Very

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:53,120
 aggressive. Queen h1. G3. This pawn obviously needs a supporter to go to G2, therefore, bishop d1,

16
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:03,920
 I mean at least that stops f3, but if he finds h3, bishop f3. It's fine, e4 then I'll have

17
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:13,040
 to sacrifice. E4. Bishop takes f takes bishop takes d5 and bishop back to f3. It's fine,

18
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:22,320
 it's not like he can find e5 and then e4. This guy is absolutely destroying me right here. King e2,

19
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,920
 I need to move this queen, or else my other queen will be overloaded. E4, queen takes h3.

20
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,920
 E6. I think that was a mouse slip as he was trying to play e5. But you know, I'm not gonna

21
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:47,360
 complain about it. Bishop takes f6 check. Finally, a check from me. King h7. Bishop e5.

22
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,520
 Everything is great, as soon as I can eliminate all of these pawns, the game will be mine.

23
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:04,480
 D6. Man this guy just doesn't like my bishop at all. I'll take this pawn. Finally, queen takes f3.

24
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:11,040
 As you can see, Stockfish now thinks it's only 3.6 for black, but to be honest, I think he just

25
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,000
 hates me because this should be better for me, and the fish just doesn't want to accept it.

26
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:25,520
 Each pawn changes gender. Queen takes queen takes queen takes e5 bishop g3 c5 bishop f2 e4 queen

27
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:32,400
 h3 c4 and in this position, there is a checkmate in 5 for white, so if you're interested, please

28
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,440
 feel free to pause the video right now to find the checkmate pattern, while I don't give you any

29
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,000
 seconds to do so, and the idea is to move the bishop closer, and then queen d7 d3 queen takes

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 f7. Checkmate. And once again, I'm better than my viewers.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:04,640
