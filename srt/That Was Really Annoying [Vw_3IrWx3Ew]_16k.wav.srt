 100 rated chess, but if your opponent blunders a piece, not pawn, you have to undo your last move.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:17,600
 Well, I guess we also have to say, not king. Very challenging. We get a 132 from Belgium.

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:28,000
 E4. Knight c6. Not very aggressive. D4, now if he plays knight e5 blundering his knight,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,560
 I will have to undo my last move, but since my last move is pushing d4, I cannot move my pawn

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:41,680
 back, so knight e5 is actually ending the video. But I mean, who plays like that anyway. Right?

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:51,120
 Of course. He takes d5, once again, since my last move was also a pawn move.

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,760
 It cannot be undone. So in no world do you blunder your knight like this.

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,240
 Yes. Knight f3. A knight move is better than a pawn move, because I can always move it back.

9
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:08,240
 Well unless he takes my knight with his queen.

10
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:16,400
 Thank you. Man, it feels like this guy can always end my video at any times he want.

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,560
 Knight c3. Of course I cannot take his queen due to the absurdity of the rules.

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,840
 But you know, he doesn't know about that. Or maybe he does. That blunders a woman,

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,400
 but sadly, knight b1 is forced. What kind of challenge is this?

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,320
 F6. Alright, now c4 attacking his queen should be better than knight c3 again,

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,320
 but I mean if he still leaves his queen there, the video ends since I cannot move my pawn backwards.

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,120
 Therefore, as much as I hate it, knight c3. Well I mean this is already the second time

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,160
 I attack his queen like this, there is no way he doesn't see it this time. Right?

18
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:09,200
 Queen e4 check. Well he did see it this time, but still blundered his woman in a different way,

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,960
 and since it is a check, I cannot undo my previous move.

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:26,960
 What the f-

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,080
