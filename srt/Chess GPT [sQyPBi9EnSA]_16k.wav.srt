00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 So a guy gave me a challenge that is actually not even his 100 rated chess, but it's a diplomatic

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,720
 mission. You must negotiate and establish peace by offering a draw to your opponent before making

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,520
 any captures or checks. I've never heard that chat GPT can also make grammar mistakes,

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:27,520
 but who cares anyway. We get a 100 rated Filipino. And since chat GPT logo is green and white,

5
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:34,800
 I decided to change my board color to match with the AI. D4. The challenge only includes my

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:47,520
 captures, so my best choice is obviously to let him capture. He takes. Bishop c5. F4. D6. I'll use

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:55,440
 the Eric Rosen special, and if the plan goes well, my first capture will be his queen. He takes d6.

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,720
 Knight e7. Oh no my horsey. And for some unknown reasons he decided to take the other way instead.

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:14,400
 But anyway. That blunders a woman. Brilliant move by the way. King takes f2 is forced. Alright.

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:21,520
 Here comes the problem. I can take his queen for free, but before I do that, I have to offer a

11
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,960
 draw, which very much may get him to agree as this capture is very easy to spot. I don't buy it.

12
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,920
 Draw offer. Yes. I'll sit here and wait for his response before taking that woman.

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:48,800
 Ah ha. Bad choice baby. Okay now please resign. Didn't happen. And the situation got really bad

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,040
 again as now I only have one good move is to take his new woman, which requires a draw offer beforehand.

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:08,400
 And he declined it again. I have no idea what he was thinking when he declined it,

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:17,120
 but I'm not complaining. G4. I'm not taking anything else this game. Bishop d7. We'll head

17
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:32,080
 straight to a quick checkmate. G5. Very aggressive. Bishop c6. F5. Rook d8. G6. Queen d4. King e1.

18
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,960
 Queen h4. A beautiful checkmate with all of my pieces are very far away from his king.

19
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:54,720
 Mission accomplished.
