00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 100 rated chess, but you're a paid actor? Give someone the best game of their life where they win.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:15,680
 You pay. I act. The worst first move I can think of? G4. This seriously weakens my king's side

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:23,200
 and also put my pawn on a square that is very easy to be attacked. Unless he doesn't want to attack it.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,280
 Doesn't matter. F4. I'm blundering queen h4 checkmate in one, which is extremely

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:43,360
 convenient for him. Or not. One more chance. I can't believe losing a king can be this difficult.

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,600
 Knight c3. Third time's a charm.

7
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,000
 You know what? I'm not gonna allow it anymore. He doesn't deserve it.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,240
 Knight f6. d4 c6 e4. Some normal development moves first, then I'll come back to my acting job.

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,080
 Bishop b4. Aha! Instead of protecting my knight with my pawn,

10
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,520
 I'll protect it with my king instead. Also allowing knight f2 friendly fork.

11
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,240
 Bishop takes. King takes. Knight e4 is also very strong.

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:35,280
 Didn't happen. e5. I'm literally forcing him to move his knight, so knight e4 is very obviously

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,880
 going to, nevermind. Rook g1. I'm attacking both knights, so he should be able to see,

14
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,200
 that the only way to save both is to give this check and then move a knight to f2.

15
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,080
 He found it. And to prove that my opponent is actually a good player and this move wasn't

16
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:01,360
 based on luck, I'll move my king here. King d3 is allowing a royal fork. So I actively avoided

17
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,000
 that fork to show you guys that he will still play knight f2 just to save his horses.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:17,200
 Exactly. Bishop h6. Queen dead. I need to take back something to make him think that I'm actually

19
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:26,560
 trying. Rook takes g4. King h8. Aha! This guy is actually very strong that he knows that his

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,240
 pawn is being pinned and thus he moves his king to remove the tactic. And we're just gonna ignore

21
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:39,680
 that it blunders a mate in 2. Random move. And he still hasn't taken my bishop yet.

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,600
 This pawn doesn't deserve to live. I'm putting everything under danger here,

23
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,520
 a simple move of developing a woman will destroy my entire position.

24
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,680
 And he chose to blunder his king instead.

25
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,280
 I quit. There is no way this guy can checkmate me,

26
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,080
 not even if he gets 7 women 1 for each day of the week. Resignation. Mission accomplished.

27
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:20,080
