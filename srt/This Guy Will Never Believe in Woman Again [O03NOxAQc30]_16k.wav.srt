1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 100 rated chess, but before starting the game, you must pick a number from 0 to 10, then

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,460
 reveal the challenge.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,600
 Of course I'm not gonna just simply choose a number.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,400
 To do this completely fair and square.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
 We'll make it random.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,320
 Very simple.

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,920
 Our number will be a random integer from 0 to 10, then we print out the result, and since

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,880
 my computer doesn't know what random is, I'll make him read a book called random.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,880
 Here we go.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,000
 Result is 1, I'll uncover the challenge.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 The number you chose is the number of pieces, and/or pawns, you must capture during the

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,760
 game, no more no less.

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,040
 This is not even a covered challenge as you can just write the entire thing down all at

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,120
 once and I'll still do the randoming part.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,300
 But it's fine.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,800
 We get a 100 rated American.

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,060
 C4.

18
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,140
 Since I cannot take too many pieces and pawns, the only way to open up the challenge, is

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,840
 to let him take mine.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
 Nevermind.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
 E5.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,880
 Let's play as aggressive as possible.

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,320
 Knight F3.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,840
 Bishop C5.

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,920
 He finally took a pawn.

26
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,560
 Queen F6.

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,360
 Knight takes F7.

28
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,720
 Ah ha.

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,480
 Here comes the problem.

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,480
 He's blundering a massive check, but if I take the check, that is not a checkmate, so

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:35,520
 I'll have to continue playing without capturing anything more while also be losing a rook.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,360
 The other option is to take the knight, but there is no initiative after that.

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,180
 Alright.

34
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,680
 I'll take this check.

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,200
 King D2.

36
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,320
 The plan is very simple.

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,080
 Queen E3 check.

38
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,880
 Draw by repetition lets go.

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,400
 Didn't happen.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
 We need more materials.

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,640
 Knight C6.

42
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,640
 I mean since his king is heavily attacked, there is no way he's taking my rook.

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,060
 Right?

44
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,800
 Knight B4 check.

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,480
 King C3.

46
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,080
 Another chance for a repetition, but I'm not taking it anymore as I may be called a coward.

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,840
 D4 check.

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,840
 King B3.

49
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
 A5.

50
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,840
 Oh no my woman.

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,720
 Ha!

52
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,520
 I bet this guy will never believe in women after this game.

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,600
 A4 king A3 knight C2.

54
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,400
 Double checkmate.

55
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,160
 Mission accomplished.

56
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:53,880
