 100 rated chess, but it's fair, all captures must be part of fair trades. The only fair trade I've

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,000
 ever had in my life is when I decided to lose my virginity instead of studying math and then get a

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:22,800
 B-. But today will be different. We get a 162 from Israel. E4. E5. Gambits are not allowed in this

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:32,880
 challenge. Nf3. Bb4. Very aggressive. That gambits a pawn, but a gambit is definitely not a part of

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,440
 a fair trade. C3. I literally have never seen this opening since I started playing chess,

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:48,880
 so let's just hope that I won't get destroyed by his preparation. Ba5. Again, cannot take that pawn,

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:58,320
 Bc4. Nf6. Aha, now taking this pawn is a part of a fair trade, but this trade actually blunders

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:10,400
 another pawn, so it turns out to be not a fair trade. D3 instead. Ng4. Bg5. F6. I'll go back

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:21,360
 this way. G5. Aha, now I really want to go Ng5 brilliant move Fg5 Qg4 Gh4 and I'll have a very

10
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:31,440
 easy to see checkmate in 12, but since that continuation breaks the rules, Bg3. Nc6. Nfd2.

11
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:43,040
 D5. That blunders a pawn in 2 different ways. But again, that's not a fair trade. Bd7. H3.

12
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,080
 And I've just realized that I actually cannot take that knight even if he blunders it.

13
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:58,560
 Fair trade, Nxe4. I mean it's fine, as long as he doesn't play a move like Bxe3 check which forces

14
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,120
 me to either take the bishop or not take the bishop which all end up as an unequal trade.

15
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,800
 The video is fine.

16
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,760
