1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 chess, but you always have to move your pieces in a specific order. Pawn, knight, bishop,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,080
 rook, queen, and king.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,880
 All right. I'm pretty sure that there's no way I can complete this mission.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,640
 But again, I can't argue with money.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,280
 Since this mission is so hard, I think I'll play 3 minutes chess, so that I can at least

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,800
 have some chances of flagging my opponent.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:39,300
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,200
 We get a 287 from Brazil.

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,000
 Pawn first. E4.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 D5.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,040
 Dude. It has only been move 2 and there are already some big issues right here.

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:03,000
 Now I have to move a horsey, but if I go knight F3, D takes E4, and I'll lose my knight on

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 the next turn since I'll have to move a bishop.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,600
 The same thing happens with knight C3, D4, or knight H3, bishop takes H3.

15
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,320
 Therefore, knight A3 is kinda forced.

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
 D takes E4.

17
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,720
 Okay a bishop move.

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,920
 Bishop E2 looks like the safest move, but it will trap my queen, which will fail the

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,040
 mission in the next 2 moves.

20
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,480
 Therefore, bishop C4.

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,640
 Knight F6.

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,880
 Rook B1 is forced.

23
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,320
 I can only hope that there is no chess master singing anything right now.

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,240
 E6.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,000
 Queen E2 is kinda forced.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,200
 Man.

27
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,360
 This is so frustrating.

28
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,360
 He is definitely going to take my horsey and there's nothing I can do about that.

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
 Knight A6.

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,400
 Thank god my horsey survived.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,180
 King F1.

32
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,860
 Knight B4.

33
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,360
 I don't know what that horsey is trying to do.

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,840
 But anyway.

35
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,480
 Back to the pawn move.

36
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,240
 C3.

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,580
 I'm making space for knight C2 next.

38
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:35,320
 Need to move my knight as long as he's still alive.

39
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,520
 Knight takes A2.

40
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,840
 That blunders a horsey.

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,920
 But of course, it's time for a horsey move.

42
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,440
 Knight C2.

43
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,600
 Knight takes C1.

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,560
 That horsey is threatening my queen, and I still cannot take it because it's a bishop's

45
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,880
 move.

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,800
 But no worries.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,280
 Bishop B5 check.

48
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,000
 Bishop block.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,720
 Rook moves, and of course, rook takes C1.

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,440
 And please don't take my bishop.

51
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:17,960
 If he takes my bishop, queen takes is forced, and that move is a check, which will bring

52
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,480
 out C6, and I lose my queen.

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,520
 Thank you.

54
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,760
 Queen back to D1.

55
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,320
 Who cares about a bishop anyway.

56
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,040
 Haha!

57
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
 You see?

58
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,640
 Even my opponent doesn't care about my bishop.

59
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,160
 But anyway.

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,600
 Now I have to move my king.

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,560
 I mean there's only one move available.

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:53,040
 But since I can already see knight takes G2 coming next, which is a check, it makes me

63
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,440
 sad.

64
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,480
 Ok man.

65
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,920
 What has to come, has to come.

66
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,560
 King E1 is forced.

67
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,680
 There you go my dude.

68
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,920
 Just go knight G2 already and destroy my mission.

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:19,360
 What the f-

70
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:33,960
 [outro]
