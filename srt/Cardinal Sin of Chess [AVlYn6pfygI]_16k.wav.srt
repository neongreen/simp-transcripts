 100 rated chess. But all of your pawns must die before the game ends.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,480
 Well I mean no one cares about the cheap pawns anyway.

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:16,480
 D4. Ah ha. The first pawn to die. Hash to be Edward. I'm so sorry Edward,

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,040
 but please remember that your sacrifice is contributing a major part to our victory.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:29,040
 Or not. G5. Okay so it's either you taking my pawn, or you taking my pawn but also blundering

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,840
 your bishop. Or none of the above. I'll take this, I mean if I start taking his pawns,

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,040
 he'll get mad and take my pawns. Or I mean he can just let me take another pawn. I'll take it.

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,200
 Okay this video is going very wrong very quickly, the original plan was me losing all my pawns,

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,000
 and somehow it changed to my opponent losing all of his pawns and I get to keep mine.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,680
 Thank god. I'll take this too. Now don't tell me that you're gonna move your king this way.

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:13,360
 Perfect. 2 down, 6 to go. D6. 5 to go. Bishop takes, I'm threatening bishop G3 check king

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,720
 takes G3 and I win his woman. So if he can just leave his queen right there for 1 move,

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,560
 that will be very convenient. And he saw the tactic. B5 of course, I mean it's pretty dangerous

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,360
 to get the queen closer like this, but the main purpose is that I need to let my pawns die.

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,760
 Half soldiers down. Bishop D7, well I mean if he can just play queen B7 blundering bishop C6

16
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:47,200
 forking his queen and his rook, that will be very convenient. Okay we all know that he's not a paid

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,400
 actor, because a paid actor would've already blundered his queen on the bishop G3 tactics

18
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,440
 like 3 moves before. Bishop C6, well at least now he won't blunder his queen in this very obvious

19
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:07,680
 situation. Or he does. Wow. Now if I take his queen, he may decide to resign, which fails the

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,040
 mission. Okay who cares knight takes C6. If I didn't take his queen, people would say that I'm

21
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,960
 a coward, and I mean since he's only down 6 points of materials, big chance is that he's not gonna

22
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:29,040
 resign here, and then I'll sacrifice my materials back to get his motivation up again. Yeah maybe

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,520
 I should've been a coward and not taken the queen.

24
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:46,160
