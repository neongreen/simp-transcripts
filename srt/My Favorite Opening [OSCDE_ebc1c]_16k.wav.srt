00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 100 rated chess, but your pieces, and pawns, are vampires, they cannot step into the light.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:15,520
 Squares. Very challenging, but definitely not impossible. We get an exact 100 rated from Poland.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:23,440
 E4. Okay so the obvious idea is to make the most usage out of my dark square bishop. Therefore,

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,960
 G5. My bishop will definitely have a good time on his longest diagonal on the entire board.

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:42,560
 D4. Bishop G7. Oh no my pawn. The pawn is dead. C5, oh no another pawn. D takes C5. That blunders

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:49,520
 a rook. Bishop takes B2. And by the way, this king's pawn opening borg defense borg gambit is

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,880
 actually one of my favorite openings as black when I was a beginner at chess, and even though now he

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,720
 has knight D2 bishop A1 queen A1 to counter attack but it's actually not that obvious for beginners

9
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:09,360
 to see. Knight A3. That blunders an entire horsey, but I'll go for queen A5 check. You know what they

10
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:17,120
 say. Give a check, it could be mate. C3. Now taking the rook is definitely the best move because queen

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,640
 recaptures can no longer counter attack on my rook, but due to the challenge's rules, my bishop

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:31,440
 obviously has more value than his rook. Therefore, I'll take this pawn instead. Queen D2. Aha, now I

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,960
 can take the rook. I mean queen trade is actually very bad for me, but he should be able to see,

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,280
 that trading queens when being down 5 points in materials is definitely not a great idea. Right?

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,560
 No doubt. But that blunders a horsey. Man this guy is so weird, he made a perfect long range

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
 discovered bishop attack on the G pawn in the opening, but then quickly blundered everything

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,920
 else in the very next moves. Queen C1. That blunders a pawn, but of course my queen cannot

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:12,320
 step out of the light. Therefore, bishop B2. King C2. Very aggressive. That blunders a queen,

19
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,960
 but let's give a check first. King B1. I have no other choices but to take this queen.

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:27,200
 Well, maybe he doesn't see that his bishop can go backward. Nevermind. A5. Let's try to get this

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,440
 rook active. Knight E2. Aha, taking this pawn is just provoking bishop E3, which not only attacks

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,720
 the queen, but also prevents rook A7, which is literally the only square that I can move my rook

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:51,120
 to. Therefore, queen back to G7. No need to rush. Knight F4. Rook A7, B6 is coming next, and all I

24
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:59,280
 can do is hope that he won't take my B pawn for just a single move. E5. Let's take this pawn first,

25
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,880
 I mean taking this rook out is kinda hard, but if he can just resign the game right now when he's

26
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:16,160
 already down 15 points in materials, that will be very convenient. Well, a win is a win, mission

27
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:31,680
 accomplished.
