1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 If a piece, not a pawn, lands on the G file,

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,500
 S1mple goes clean the garbage,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,000
 playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,500
 and apparently, this guy is a Dragon Ball fan,

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,500
 remember this guys, remember, this.

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
 Alright, let's find an opponent.

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,500
 We get a 1-16 from Australia.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,500
 Ah ha! White pieces.

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,500
 The most obvious threat is definitely G6 and BG7.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,500
 Therefore, B3.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:50,500
 If I can control the G7 square first, there's no more threat.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,500
 G6.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,500
 G6. Thank god I prepared for that.

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
 Bb2.

15
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500
 Well of course he can still play Bb7,

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,500
 but there's no way he cannot see that it's a huge blunder, right?

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 Nh6.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 That blunders a rook.

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,000
 But should I even take it though?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Because not only Bg7 is a threat,

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,500
 but also Ng4.

22
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
 Nah, it's fine.

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,000
 Bxh8.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,500
 I mean no one plays such an absurd move like Ng4, right?

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,500
 F6.

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,500
 Yeah, that move makes sense.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,500
 But of course, I still need to prevent Ng4.

28
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,500
 Therefore, H3.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Nf5.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Ah ha! He obviously want Bg7,

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 defended by the f5 horsey.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Therefore, E4.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Of course there's no such thing like Ng2-G3, right?

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Nd6.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Perfect!

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 No more threats now.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Nc3.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Maybe it's finally time, for me to have, an absolutely normal chess game.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Nf7.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Ah ha! Now I understand what he wanted.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 The knight started on H6,

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 to f5, to d6, and then to f7,

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 so that he can capture my bishop, which is trapped on H8.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 And by the way, let's just totally ignore the fact that he can just go there,

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 in one f***ing move.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 But anyway, let's just continue the game.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Bc4.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 He took my bishop.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Alright.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Now Bg7 is unavoidable.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 So I guess,

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 E5.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 That was a pawn, but I need to distract him from playing that move.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 f5.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Well, at least he got distracted.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 But again, that move is still a threat.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 G4.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Please take it.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Well at least just please push it like you did the last time.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Fxg4.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Qxg4.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 That blunders a pawn.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Is he going to c?

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 d5, bishop b5 check, c6, queen d4, cxb5, e6, b4,

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 knight back to e2, queen b6, queen takes H8,

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 and finally, queen takes e6 winning a pawn.

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 (I'm not sure what I was doing here)

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Okay, I'll clean up the garbage.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 (I'm not sure what I was doing here)

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 (I'm not sure what I was doing here)
