00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 Christmas special. You give away any pieces, not pawns, when possible. But if the opponent

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,800
 doesn't take it, the video ends. This is not gonna go well, we get a 1 29 from Chili.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,960
 Since I'll have to sacrifice my pieces when it's possible, let's just delay the development,

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:31,200
 as much as possible. A3. E5. Ah ha, he obviously wants to push E4, which forces me to play knight

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:43,200
 F3, which gives away my horsey, which is not good. Therefore, F3. Bishop C5. C3. A preemptive move to

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:54,240
 D5. Knight F6. Pushing center pawns is just killing my bishops. Therefore, G3. I want to go bishop G2,

7
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:02,320
 and then we can push our E-pawn forward. Knight D5. Bishop G2. Exactly as planned.

8
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:11,040
 Queen G5. That blunders a bishop to D4, but if I go D4, after he moves his queen away,

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,120
 I'll have to sacrifice my bishop, instead of taking his bishop. And even though I can sacrifice

10
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:25,040
 my king now by going H4, queen takes G3 check, king F1 is forced, queen F2 checkmate, I think

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:33,280
 we can just exempt the king, from the mission's rules. Therefore, B3. Now if he goes B5,

12
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:44,160
 I won't have to go queen A4 sacrificing my queen anymore. Ha! Knight E3. That blunders a horsey.

13
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:52,240
 But I can't take it, because I have to sacrifice my pieces. I mean I can just move my queen away

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,680
 and sacrifice my bishop instead, but funnily enough, my queen is trapped. Are you serious?

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,120
 B4. I don't know about that move, I just didn't want to waste more time thinking,

16
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:16,080
 because as you can see, I'm down more than 1 minute already. Knight takes D1. Alright. Bishop

17
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:26,400
 B2 is forced. I totally shouldn't have pushed that B-pawn. Knight takes B2. It's fine. B takes C5.

18
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,480
 Knight C4. You know what? Let's take a risk. Knight H3. That is a very dangerous move,

19
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,160
 because if he just moves his queen back, I'll have to sacrifice my knight. But you know,

20
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,600
 since I'm already pretty much losing this game, I'll have to take as many chances as possible.

21
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,800
 Yeah. Didn't work. Knight F4 is kinda forced. I mean he may decide to take with queen. Right?

22
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,200
 Yeah. Also didn't work. Bishop H3 is forced.

23
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:13,200
 Ha! You know what? This is the first time that I'm happy when the video ends,

24
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,560
 since I don't want to get checkmated in a video. But anyway. What the f-
