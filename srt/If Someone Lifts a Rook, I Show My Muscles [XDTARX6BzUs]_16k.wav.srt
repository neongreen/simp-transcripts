00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 If someone lifts a rook, simp shows his muscles.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Yeah, I can see that our guy RoyMeta971 has already shown a lot of his muscles right here.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 But anyway, finally, after all of those videos, I finally have, an absolutely, normal, game.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 We get a 138 from Vietnam.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 E4.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Well, unless he plays something like H5, the video is definitely safe.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Yes! E6.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 D4.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Nothing can go wrong.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Knight F6.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Even better, E5.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 If his knight is attacked, he cannot open up his rook's ways.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Knight G4.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 That blunders a horsey.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Oh, wait.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 I think I shouldn't have done that.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Ha! Not even close.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Bishop D3.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Well some people may tell me that I should have moved my queen back.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 But I mean, if I didn't get attacked last time, I wouldn't get attacked this time, right?

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Of course.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Bishop takes H7.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Even though rook takes H7 ends the video, he should be able to see, that rook takes H7 is blundering a rook to queen G6 check, king E7 is forced, and queen takes H7.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Ha! You see? It only took him around 3 seconds to realize that that rook lift is just a big blunder.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 But anyway. That C6 move is actually blundering a king, so feel free to pause the video here and find the forced checkmate in 4 for white, while I give you a couple of seconds.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So for those of you who were able to do it, congratulations. And for those of you who just want to enjoy the show, the move is bishop G6 check, king E7 is forced, queen G5 check, king D6 is forced, and before continuing the video, I just want to tell you that I also have another channel, featuring some very random games around the internet.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 So please feel free to check it out through the link in the description below.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 King takes E5 check, king back to E7 is forced, and bishop to G5, checkmate.

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 And once again, since the video is so short, I'll try to answer some of your comments.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Okay what actually is an M? Okay I answered a question like this in yesterday's video, but it's fine to say again, that if you doesn't know about it yet, I would suggest you totally not knowing about it, because once you've known about something, you can't unknow it.

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Your voice is different, I like the old one more, but maybe I'll get used to this.

32
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Are you serious?

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Now I would like the tutorial.
