1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 100 rated chess, but the queen is an intercontinental ballistic missile, you must launch her once as capture or checkmate, then she has exploded and cannot move again.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 And she cannot be captured.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Ha, in case you don't remember, I've never lost a single challenge about women.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 D3. Not very aggressive.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 E5. Since I cannot play with my queen too early into the game, taking the center and playing like a normal match should be the best way to tackle this challenge.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Bishop E3.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 D5. Have to say that I think this move is very suspicious.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 And I was right.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 That blunders a bishop. I mean a resignation means this challenge is failed, but who resigns after only losing a single bishop anyway?

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Right?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Of course.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Bishop E4. Let's see if he wants to blunder his knight as well.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 He doesn't. I'll pull it back.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 D4. I'll take that pawn.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Maybe provoking his queen out is not such a good idea because it can lead to a queen trade which ends the video, but of course, I'm not a coward.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Queen takes D4.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Knight F6, queen D5, bishop C3, queen D2, queen D2, checkmate will be extremely convenient.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Of course it doesn't happen.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Bishop E6.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Queen back to D4 again.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Knight C6.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Logically speaking, I actually don't want to take his queen because that is just provoking a resignation, but since he doesn't know about it, attacking the woman should always be a good choice.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Queen A4.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 D4. Let's see if he sees rook D1.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Wow.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Not only did he see rook E1, he even saw that if he castles queenside, his rook will still be put on D1 to pin my pawn into my queen.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 I'm scared.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Castle.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Knight B5.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Bishop B6. I can't believe that after blundering a bishop on move 3, this guy really didn't blunder anything else in the next 10 moves.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 And he even baits me to blunder my queen.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Knight A5.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Alright, let's see who baits who.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 A random king move. That blunders a fork.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 Rook takes D4.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Ah ha, taking the queen should be the best move, but since I cannot lose my queen, I have to take the rook.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Knight takes D4.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 That blunders a woman, and since I'm already very close to a checkmate, I'll take it.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 That is a very risky choice, but since this guy hasn't blundered anything until these recent moves, I need to take my chance and destroy his position.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 B3.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Knight takes.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Knight E6.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Ah ha, that blunders queen D1 king B2 queen C1 king A2 queen A1 checkmate in 3, but since my queen can only move once for a checkmate, I have to take his knight instead.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 It's fine, the checkmate is very close, and since he didn't resign after losing his queen, there's no reason to resign after losing just another horsey.

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 What the f-
