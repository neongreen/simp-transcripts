1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 100 rated chess, but each series of 8 moves has to be on each unique file.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,200
 Well, I normally don't take on challenges that are too strict, or too hard to understand,

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,600
 because I also need my viewers to understand the challenge.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,960
 But of course, I can't argue with money.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,280
 So anyway.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,440
 We get a 270 from the US.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,280
 In a normal game of chess, most of the things happen in the center of the board.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,920
 Therefore, I think I should go with A3.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,320
 I strongly believe that I should reserve my center moves for emergencies, since I can

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,680
 only land a move on the file, once.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,360
 E5.

12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,800
 H3.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,520
 No reason to move in the center yet.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,040
 C5.

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,040
 Very aggressive.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,080
 D3.

17
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,080
 Knight F6.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,880
 G3.

19
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,520
 Everything is still fine.

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,640
 Ok it's not fine.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,160
 D3.

22
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:11,040
 Please leave my house little horsey.

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,560
 Or not.

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,080
 That blunders a horsey, and since the E file is still available.

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,480
 Of course I'll take it.

26
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,120
 Knight D4.

27
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,800
 Man, this guy is really aggressive with his horses.

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,880
 Knight F3 looks really good, but if he goes knight takes F3, I cannot take back, since

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,200
 I will have to make a C file move.

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,440
 Therefore, C3.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,400
 Knight takes B3.

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,240
 That blunders a horsey.

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,720
 But since I have to make an F file move, I cannot take it.

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,540
 Which makes me lose a rook.

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,320
 This mission is getting very wrong very quickly.

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,640
 Knight F3.

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,280
 And he didn't even take it.

38
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,120
 Now since the series of 8 moves has been reset, rook K2 should be the best move.

39
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,600
 But I think that, I should take a risk.

40
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,880
 E3.

41
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:16,880
 Unlike you guys who can see the available files on the screen, I'm actually using a

42
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:22,900
 notebook in real life to note down the files, so unless I'm taking risk, I'm so going to

43
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,920
 lose on time.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,760
 Knight takes A1.

45
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,440
 Bishop takes C4.

46
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,600
 A5.

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,700
 Man, this guy has to be the most aggressive opponent I have ever met.

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,200
 Queen D5.

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,960
 Now please don't see anything.

50
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,860
 Knight C2 check.

51
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,920
 That blunders a horsey.

52
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,340
 Because now I can go king D2, which counterattack his knight, and after he defends the checkmate

53
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,960
 threat, I can win his knight.

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:04,900
 But sadly, I have already made a move on the D file, which means, king F1 is kinda forced.

55
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,200
 Oh, wait.

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,720
 On second thought, maybe this guy is actually a genius.

57
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,760
 Because it seems like he knows that my king cannot move to the E or D file, so he gave

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,240
 a check, which forces king F1, and now since my king has already landed on the F file,

59
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,080
 my queen cannot checkmate his king anymore, due to the mission.

60
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,080
 Are you serious?

61
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,680
 A4.

62
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,520
 That blunders a king.

63
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,360
 But it feels like my opponent is actually laughing into my face that I cannot checkmate

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,200
 him, even though it is right there.

65
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
 You know what?

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,840
 Who cares?

67
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,520
 Queen takes F7, checkmate, mission accomplished.

68
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:07,520
