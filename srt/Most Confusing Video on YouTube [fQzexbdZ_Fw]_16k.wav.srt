 100 rated chess, but you don't tell us what side of the match you are playing as,

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,520
 then make a community poll for people to guess. Ha! Let's see how smart my viewers are.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,480
 We get an unknown opponent from an unknown country. First move. E4. Changing side,

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,760
 since my opponent playing white has played E4. E5. Playing white, and since I'm playing against

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:32,800
 a beginner, there is no better opening, than queen H5. Trust me, he's gonna blunder his king very

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,360
 soon. Black side, since I'm actually playing black, I don't want my viewers to guess that I'm playing

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,160
 black. Therefore, I'm blundering my E4. I'm actually playing white, but since I also don't

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,840
 want my viewers to guess that I'm playing white, I'm not gonna take that pawn. My opponent is

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,920
 threatening a scholar's mate, so of course I have to block it. This pawn is free, but since I'm

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,760
 actually playing black and not white, I didn't see that. Blocking the threat with the knight is

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,600
 obviously the best move, but since I'm actually playing white and black is a 100 rated opponent,

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,920
 black decided to push this pawn instead. Truthfully saying, I'm actually playing white,

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,080
 so I made the best move of capturing this pawn. Taking this pawn is blundering a checkmate in 2,

14
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,040
 and since I'm not playing black, black blundered the king. White sees the checkmate, queen H5 check.

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,920
 King F8. And in fact, white didn't see the checkmate because I actually was playing black,

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
 developing a knight instead. Defending the checkmate will make people think I'm actually

17
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,880
 playing black. Knight F6. D4. Opening up the center. That blunder's a queen, and since I'm

18
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,040
 truly playing black this game, I of course saw the blunder. White gives a check. To prove that

19
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,000
 I'm actually playing black and not white, I make a backward knight move. Ha, no way a 100 rated

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,520
 player knows how to make a backward move. Taking a pawn. Nothing special here. Developing a bishop,

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,240
 nothing special here. Knight F3. And since black is having too much advantage, I need to make the

22
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:23,040
 game balance, queen F6. And in this position, one side resigned, but of course I'm not gonna show

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,240
 the ending screen because it shows the side I was playing. The poll for voting on which side

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:40,960
 that I played will be made 60 minutes after the video is published, link in the description.
