00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 100 rated chess, but you have to mirror your opponent, every 3 moves. That sounds pretty fun,

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:17,760
 but at the same time, pretty impossible. We get a 191 from Singapore. E4. Ah ha! E5. The plan is

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,080
 simple, I just have to mirror every single one of his moves, until it is impossible to do so anymore.

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:35,280
 Knight F3. Knight F6. Mirror everything baby! Bishop C4. Ah ha! Now the challenge truly begins.

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,840
 Bishop C5 is forced. I mean that blunders a pawn, but it's better than blundering a video.

6
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:50,320
 Knight G5. Ah ha! Now the mirror everything plan doesn't work anymore because knight G4 is just

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,000
 blundering a knight, and even though castling looks really good right now, it is a unique move,

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,200
 which means if I castle right now, I won't be able to mirror his castle in the future,

9
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:10,160
 which is bad for the video. Therefore, D5 is kinda forced. E takes D5. H6 looks really strong,

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,160
 but since I'll have to mirror his next move, knight back to F3 is not a move that I can mirror.

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:22,400
 So I guess, bishop back to D6, I mean let's just hope that he won't play knight C3 which

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,640
 forces knight C6 blundering a horse. Nevermind. Knight C6 is forced.

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:36,480
 It's fine, it's just a horsey anyway, but the real problem is now the F7 threat is up again,

14
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,400
 and bishop E6 is bad because knight E6 F E6 bishop E6 and I cannot mirror that move.

15
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:50,080
 Therefore, I guess I have to go with, bishop G4. You know what they say. If you can't defend

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:02:00,240
 yourself, attack their woman. F3. Thank god. Bishop H5. Alright, at least that defends the F7

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,720
 pawn, and if he can just castle right now, that will be very convenient.

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,880
 Ha, you see? Reserving castling is obviously my best decision in this video. Castle is forced.

19
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:23,920
 Ok, now everything is good, let's try to strike back. Well, but let's try to retreat first.

20
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,880
 You know what they say, if you want to go forward, you need to go backward. Knight takes F7.

21
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:38,720
 Oh no. That blunders a horsey, but if I take with bishop, he will 100% move his bishop next,

22
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,920
 and I won't be able to mirror that move, which means I'll have to end the video, and even if I

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,000
 take with rook, I also won't be able to mirror bishop takes F7, and the video is still going to

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,080
 end. So I guess, my one and only move now is, bishop C5 check. Now please block the check with

25
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:07,440
 your rook and force me to mirror it with rook F7. Yeah there's no way this challenge is possible.
