1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 I'm better than my viewers, I call checkmate operation.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,560
 Man, these position names always sound so cringe.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,520
 But anyway, welcome to another I'm better than my viewers video, and the victim this

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:21,000
 time is a guy called me coolass12, at the very average rating of 1500.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,760
 I'll take this pawn, I mean even though 1500 is just average, playing against an average

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,440
 opponent in a -10 position, is probably not a very good situation to be in.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
 Rook takes.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,000
 Ah ha.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,520
 That blunders a woman.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,760
 I mean even though he has 2 wives, they are always so far away from him, so I'm down to

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,080
 say that I'm more happy than him having only 1 woman but she's always right next to me.

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,160
 Woman takes.

13
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,480
 I'll take this rook.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,660
 I mean there were too many choices, so I just picked a random one.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,660
 Rook f8.

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,800
 Okay that move looks like what a paid actor would do, but I'm not gonna complain about

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,800
 it.

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,560
 He takes f8 and turns to be an animal.

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,000
 Well I mean maybe he'll think that a horsey is too small of a target to waste a move to

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 capture.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Nevermind.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,720
 I'll take this pawn, I've just realized that if he had promoted this pawn earlier, things

23
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,640
 might have gone really bad, but I guess somehow both of us actually did not even consider

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,320
 that possibility.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,840
 Rook takes horsey.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,880
 C7 c8 turning into a rook.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,080
 Rook takes bishop takes queen takes.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,480
 The situation is getting pretty dangerous as he has a lot of free space up here to move

29
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,160
 around, therefore, let's trade off the queens.

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,840
 I mean he'll most likely not going to take it.

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,640
 Well.

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,280
 Very convenient.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,880
 C takes b7.

34
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,000
 Alright, now the game gets into the boring phase known as.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 The endgame.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,400
 Rook f8 c6 rook b8 king c5 rook f2 c7 rook f8 king e6 maybe c6 was better e2 rook e1

37
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:10,400
 rook g2 c1 petrified rook takes pawn takes rook e8 d5 king g4 d e4 king f3 bishop c1

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,400
 king f2 bishop d2 rook g1 rook g1 king g1 and after a few more moves, I took away his

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,920
 rook, but since he said he wants to continue playing, I figured that this is an amazing

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:27,040
 chance to get a harem, so I made 5 wives, and when I'm preparing to make a 6th one,

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,320
 I stalemated him.

42
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,760
 Well, I guess it's not always good to have many wives all at once.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
 But anyway.

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,800
 I'm better than my viewers.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:52,580
 *Outro music*
