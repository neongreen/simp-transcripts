00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 100 rated chess. But you have to take any pieces or pawns when it is possible for you to do so.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Well, this is obviously going to be a total disaster. But again, I can't argue with money.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Therefore, let's find an opponent.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 We get a 268 from Australia.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 E4.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 E5.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 So far so good, as long as he doesn't play such an absurd move like A3, forces bishop takes A3.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 D3.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Very solid.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Nc6.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 I can already see a lot of you guys are going to say, oh you should have played d6, since it stops the bishop from seeing A3.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Well, that's right, but I don't think he's going to play that move, so there's no need to do such thing.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 G4.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Very aggressive.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 He's obviously threatening to go G5, forcing queen takes G5, which blunders a woman.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Therefore, H6.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 H4.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 You know what?

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I'm just going to end this video here. I don't want to play this game anymore, sayonara, see you tomorrow.
