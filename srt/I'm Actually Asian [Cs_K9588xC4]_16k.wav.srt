 I'm better than my viewers. You are white. No I'm actually Asian. But it's fine.

00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,640
 Girls and boys and people in the middle, welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers,

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,200
 and today's viewer is an 800 rated guy called... Nando.

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:24,720
 D5. A wise man once said, "If you have a past pawn, push him until he's passed."

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:34,480
 Knight D7. Pawn push. Bishop takes pawn takes rook takes. Rook D3 putting his rook behind my

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,360
 pawn will be very dangerous. Rook D4. There is no need to defend this pawn, as it takes too much

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:49,360
 effort to actually make that pawn valuable to my position. He took it. Rook H2 will also be very

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,800
 dangerous. Rook D2. This rook alone will act as my defender, now I only need a chance to use the

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:06,080
 other one to make some counterplays. Rook HH1. He wants a skewer. I'll protect my rook. A trade

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,360
 should be bad for me, but managing to have two pawns very far forward may get him to tremble a

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:21,360
 little bit. F4. I want rook A7, but there is a skewer, so king B3 first. I'll move my king around

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,440
 this pawn to avoid future checks, but in this position, my opponent made a monstrous positional

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:35,680
 decision. Rook H3 king B2 rook H1. He spent two moves just to bring my king back to B2, so that

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,600
 if he checks me next, I cannot move my king in front of my pawn to avoid the checks, which seriously

15
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,600
 reduce my king's safety, and even though I can move him back to B3 aiming for a repetitional

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,360
 draw, he knows I definitely won't do that as I'm obviously not a coward. Rook K7 then. That was a

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,040
 really bad move as it puts my king in a lot of danger, but since he's playing like a grandmaster

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,480
 right now, I'd rather take a risk. Check check king D3. Rook B3 then I guess I'll resign.

19
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:17,840
 Nevermind. That blunders a horsey. Finally, the unpaid actor part is kicking in.

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:27,440
 Now he checks. King up. G5. And with that, this game is now a draw.

21
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,920
 Actually it's a win. I'm better than my viewers.

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:48,400
