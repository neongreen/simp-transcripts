 100 rated chess, but if your opponent moves a piece, you move a pawn, and vice versa.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,520
 Sounds fun. We get a 137 from Brazil.

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,000
 E4. That's a pawn move, so I have to move a piece.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,800
 Queen h5 check. Very aggressive. Queen is also a piece, therefore, g6.

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,560
 Queen c5. E5 is obviously the best move. But I'm afraid, that there is a chance that he's

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,400
 gonna blunder queen takes e5, thinking that it forks my king and rook, and since it's a piece

7
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,560
 move, I'll have to move a pawn, and since there is no legal pawn move, I'll have to end my video.

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,200
 So I guess. E6. You know what people say. Better be safe than sorry.

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,040
 Knight c3. That blunders a queen, but since it's a piece move, I guess I finally have to play.

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,600
 E5. You know, moving the other pawns may get him to notice that his queen is being attacked.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:17,120
 Aha! Now that really blunders a queen. Knight d5. Oh no. I have a feeling,

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,160
 that bad stuff is going to happen, very soon. Now there are knight f6 and knight c7 check ending the

13
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:31,120
 video, because there is no legal pawn move in a knight check. But sadly, I have to move a pawn.

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,680
 All I can do, is just to pray, that he doesn't end my video right now.

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:44,640
 Yes. Another pawn move. Let's just hope that I can move my bishop and take his knight quickly

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:56,320
 for the video's safety. Bishop e2. Another pawn move. Castle. Another pawn move. Man. At this

17
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:04,720
 point, I'm afraid that I'll have to move the pawns for the entire game. Knight d2. Pawn again. I mean

18
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:14,160
 as long as he doesn't end my video, I'm fine with keeping moving pawns forward. C3. Aha! Finally.

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:23,200
 Bishop e6. Okay. Come on. Just one more pawn move, and I can finally get rid of this dangerous horsey.

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,800
 What the f-
