00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 100 rated chess, but you're playing Pokemon, you can only use pieces after capturing them with your

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,400
 pawns. Considering the fact that I only have 2 Pokeballs on me right now, this is going to be

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,640
 hard. E3. The very famous Vant Krooge's opening. Since I haven't caught any Pokemons yet, I can

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:31,440
 only move my pawns. Bishop D3. Ah ha. D5. The plan is very simple. Knight F3, E4, and a piece.

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:42,880
 Exactly as planned. E4. Bishop E5. A desperate attempt to save the bishop. C6. We changed from

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,400
 a fork to a double attack. And who knows, maybe he'll decide to play Queen E2 which lets me take

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,240
 his knight and once again create a new double attack at his queen and his bishop.

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:01,600
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. I'll catch this horsey. That was his G file

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,920
 knight, therefore, now my G file knight is activated, and there is no better G file name,

10
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:17,760
 than jail. Not jail, it's jail. Totally different. Queen takes F3. I'll use my second ball.

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,960
 That was his F file bishop, and I think we already agreed that this bishop is Frank.

12
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:32,640
 G4. Frank, I choose you. Frank to C5. I mean it will be very problematic if he takes my F pawn

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,600
 because I haven't captured his king yet. But who plays like that anyway? Right?

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:48,480
 I'm worrying too much. Jail to F6. D4. Frank back. I mean the most realistic plan is to use

15
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,200
 these pieces to trade with the other equivalent pieces so that I can continue to activate new

16
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,080
 pieces into the game, but I guess it'll be a little bit problematic if he keeps playing like

17
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:08,080
 a coward like this. G5. Very aggressive. Jail E4. Rook H3. I cannot take that rook because this

18
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:21,200
 bishop cannot move yet. But still, I have another plan. H6. G takes H6. G5. H takes G5. Ha! Jail

19
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:31,280
 takes G5, forking a queen and a rook. Queen H5. H file rook, and the name will be, Thomas.

20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,280
 Queen H4. Ah ha! That blunders a queen, but I cannot take her due to the rules, so he is

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,080
 actually threatening to take my queen with a check which forces my king to move which ends this

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,360
 video. So I guess. Jail to G5. I'm threatening jail F3 royal fork which activates my woman,

23
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,760
 so the best thing he can do right now is to retreat his queen all the way into the very

24
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,960
 corner of the board, which is pretty satisfying when you think about it. F4. That blunders a

25
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:12,000
 royal fork, jail to F3 but mouse slipped. But anyway, I mean he should be able to see that he

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,600
 is now being down a lot of materials, so trading queens is obviously not a very good idea.

27
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,800
 And since I saw that was coming, there is no what the f*** today.

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:41,360
