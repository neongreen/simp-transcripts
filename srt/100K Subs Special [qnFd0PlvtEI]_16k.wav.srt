00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
 100,000 sub special, 100 rated chess, but if your opponent falls below 100% accuracy,

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,080
 you show your silver button. I mean I don't have this thing yet, so let's just change it to.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,160
 The video ends. This is going to be short, so according to the challenge, I need to let him

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,720
 always play the very best move. Therefore, E4. The first move is very difficult to predict,

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:34,400
 so E4 E5 should be my best attempt to keep this video alive. Exactly as planned. Okay,

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,320
 now comes the hard part. If I just play a normal move, big chance is that he won't be able to find

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,720
 the very best move because there are too many moves to consider. Therefore, B4. Alright,

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:51,680
 I'm making it very clear that bishop takes B4 is the best move, and let's just hope that he's

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:00,320
 not one of those guys who just want to move their woman out on the second move. Aha! I was wrong,

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,600
 I thought that queen g5 was literally the worst move in the position, but Stockfish actually said

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,840
 that bishop takes B4 was the best move, knight F6 is an alternative, but queen g5 is also an

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:20,320
 alternative. Yeah. Trust. F4, queen takes is obviously best, and since he likes to move his

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,480
 queen, there is no way he can miss it this time. Right? No doubt. This is actually getting pretty

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:35,360
 dangerous, so even though I don't really like this move. I have to do it. Alright, now just calm

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,400
 down, my bishop is attacking your queen, now just go queen H4 check G3 queen D8, or I mean just queen

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,680
 F6 right now is also fine, and of course in no world do you go bishop takes B4 here because

17
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,160
 because that blunders a double attack. Well, since I cannot make a good excuse for that move,

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,000
 the video ends, but since this is the 100,000 subs special video, I'll answer some of your

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,040
 questions instead. Why don't you pay your actors? I have no idea what you're talking about.

20
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,640
 What is your opinion on tomatoes? They suck. You avoided this question before, but now you got to

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,920
 be honest since it is 100k subs special, what is your favorite h***? Ah ha, I can see that this guy

22
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,280
 is a long time viewer, but of course I'm not going to answer this question because I don't want to

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,600
 be demonetized. Milk first or cereal first? I actually have never even seen a real cereal in

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,280
 my life, so I'll say that I'll eat it dry. Which is better, leech s or chess dot com? Since none

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,280
 of them gave me money to say good things about them, I'll say they both suck. What is your

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,000
 favorite flavor of ice cream? Peanuts. What settings do you use to hide account names in videos?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,600
 It's called editing. Do you feel bad for the 100 rated players? Of course not.
