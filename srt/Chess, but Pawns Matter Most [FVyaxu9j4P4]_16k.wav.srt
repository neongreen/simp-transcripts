1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 Chess, but you can only capture with pawns.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,880
 And wow!

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,520
 That's a lot of money.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,680
 But anyway, let's find an opponent.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,520
 That was fast.

6
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,960
 We get a 150 from the US.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,640
 Since all of the pieces are pretty much useless, let's play really.

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,600
 I mean really.

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
 Aggressively.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,240
 E4.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,120
 E6.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,960
 Not very aggressive.

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,520
 But that's actually perfect for my mission.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,000
 D4.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,080
 D6.

16
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,800
 F4.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,360
 Let's make a huge...

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,920
 Pawnstorm.

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,320
 Bishop E7.

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,280
 C4.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,840
 Bishop D7.

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,480
 Man!

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,380
 This guy has to be the nicest opponent I have ever got.

24
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:10,640
 But anyway, that doesn't stop me from playing very aggressively.

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,040
 B4.

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,600
 G5.

27
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,400
 Aha!

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,320
 Very aggressive.

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,440
 H4.

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,360
 B5.

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,920
 Again, very aggressive.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,200
 But anyway, that blunders a pawn.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
 Oh, wait.

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,840
 On second thought, maybe taking on the other side was better.

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,760
 C5.

36
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,440
 I'll take it this time then.

37
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,700
 And I can already see some people getting mad in the comments section for declining

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,960
 the French move.

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,080
 F5.

40
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,920
 Okay okay.

41
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,080
 I'll take it this time.

42
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080
 Bishop takes.

43
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:07,720
 Okay now bishop H4 looks kinda scary.

44
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,560
 Therefore, queen H5 check.

45
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,040
 I mean my pieces can't take.

46
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,840
 But they can still check.

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,980
 White.

48
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,020
 King E7.

49
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,400
 Very aggressive.

50
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,340
 Bishop C4.

51
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,700
 Bishop takes D4.

52
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,740
 F5.

53
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,180
 Please take.

54
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,020
 Yes!

55
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,420
 Queen F7.

56
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,420
 Check.

57
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,420
 Mate!

58
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,780
 Mission accomplished.

59
00:02:47,040 --> 00:03:01,480
