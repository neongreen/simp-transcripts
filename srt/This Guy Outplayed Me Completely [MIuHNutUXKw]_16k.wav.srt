1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 100 rated chess, but you're a penguin.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,000
 Every time you kill a prey, you must bring the piece back to its original position,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,360
 in order to share the loot.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,080
 Well, then I guess we'll have to say...

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,520
 Not porn.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,440
 Very challenging.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,160
 This is one of those challenges where my opponent can actually win the game against me,

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,960
 and then my viewers will start to dislike the video,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,960
 and then the view count will be really low,

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,440
 and then my channel will start to die.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,600
 But of course, I'm not a coward.

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:30,740
 E4.

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,960
 D6.

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,080
 Not very aggressive.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,300
 D4.

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,040
 C5.

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,960
 Ha, now it became a very weird Sicilian.

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,160
 I'll take this porn.

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,160
 Knight D7.

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,280
 I'll take this too.

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,400
 Edward takes, bishop C4.

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,800
 Knight GF6.

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,000
 Knight C3.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,240
 Man this guy is actually playing pretty well compared to my usual opponents.

25
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,000
 Nevermind.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
 That blunders a horsey.

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
 Alright, now the challenge truly begins.

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,360
 My next two moves have to be bringing my knight back,

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,440
 so if he plays a move like Qe7 to pin my knight to my king,

30
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,880
 that will end the video,

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,400
 but he should be able to see,

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,240
 that Qe7 is just blundering Qe2 threatens knight takes D6 check king D8 is forced

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,280
 knight takes F7 check and forks his rook in the corner.

34
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,420
 Right?

35
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,880
 Of course, he's obviously attacking my bishop,

36
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,200
 but sadly, I have to move my knight.

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,640
 I'm sorry Frank, but you need to die for the video.

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,440
 Goodbye Frank.

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,640
 Knight B1 is forced, and would you look at that.

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,000
 After 9 moves into the game, all of my pieces are still in their original positions,

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,120
 except for David, Edward, and Frank.

42
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,360
 Queen F6.

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,420
 C3.

44
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,800
 Bishop F5.

45
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,240
 Ah ha, that blunders a horsey to Qa4 check king D8 queen takes E4,

46
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,440
 but if I do that right now, I will then have to spend at least 2 moves to move my queen back,

47
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,040
 so a move like Qe5 check will immediately end the video.

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,720
 Therefore, let's go knight E2 first,

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,040
 this move blocks any future queen checks,

50
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,000
 and let's just hope that he will continue to blunder his knight.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,360
 Ha! You see, if it wasn't for my cautious play,

52
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,680
 the video would've already ended by now.

53
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,520
 Qa4 check,

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,640
 I mean now he actually has B5 to defend the knight,

55
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
 but why not just try my luck anyway.

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,040
 There we go.

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
 That blunders another horsey.

58
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,720
 Alright, as mentioned before, now I have to spend at least 2 moves to move my queen back,

59
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,040
 so in no world do you give a check now.

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,520
 Thank you.

61
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,040
 Queen B3, how about rook back to B8?

62
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,680
 That also works.

63
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
 Queen D1 is forced.

64
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,200
 Man, even though I have 3 points of material advantage,

65
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,160
 this position doesn't seem to be advantageous at all.

66
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,560
 Rook C4.

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,360
 Knight A3.

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
 Rook E4.

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,520
 Ah ha, he's obviously trying to stop me from castling

70
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,560
 because that will drop the king's protection on my knight.

71
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,480
 Therefore, bishop E3.

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,240
 D5.

73
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,600
 Castle.

74
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:22,800
 I actually didn't want to castle because that will put my king in the starting position of my G knight,

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,320
 which means this knight won't be able to capture anything as long as the king is still on that G1 square.

76
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,880
 But since the situation has become too dangerous, I guess I didn't have a choice.

77
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,120
 D4.

78
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,880
 That blunders a pawn.

79
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,800
 Alright, now I'll have to spend 2 moves to move my bishop back,

80
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,080
 so in no world do you go queen takes H2 check now.

81
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,560
 Of course.

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,080
 Oh, wait.

83
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,280
 Actually that's not really good because after bishop E3,

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,080
 he may decide to take my queen, which I cannot take back because bishop C1 is forced.

85
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
 Bishop E3.

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,200
 Okay dude, you're being down 4 points of materials, so you shouldn't be trading queens right now.

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,160
 Rook H4.

88
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,240
 Oh, wait.

89
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,360
 That is even worse.

90
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,040
 Dude.

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,400
 Now bishop C1 is forced, which blunders a king.

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,080
 Well I mean there's a chance that he's not gonna play that move.

93
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,040
 Right?

94
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:33,040
 Yeah there's no way this guy is 200 rated.

95
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:47,440
