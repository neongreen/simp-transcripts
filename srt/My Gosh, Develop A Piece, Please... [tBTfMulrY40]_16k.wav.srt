 [Music]

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 You're a stupid child

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 You chase your dreams and get hurt

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 You're bad at lying

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 But you show me a smile that doesn't make me laugh

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 You're bad at saying "I love you"

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 You're really clumsy

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 But why did you say "goodbye"?

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 You're no good, no good, no good

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 You're too dark and too innocent

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 No matter how strong the alcohol

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Memories that don't waver

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 You're a stupid child

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 You're a stupid child, really stupid

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 You just believe

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 You pretend to be a strong woman

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 And bathe in the night wind of sadness

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Three years have passed since you became alone

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Even the cityscape has changed

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 You left only regrets in the window

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 You're a really bad man

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I'll take off your ring

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 I'll make a fuss

24
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I'm waiting for you

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 You're a stupid child

26

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 You're no good, no good, no good

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 You're too dark and too innocent

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 No matter how strong the alcohol
