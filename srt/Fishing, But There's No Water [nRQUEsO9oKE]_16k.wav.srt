00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 100 rated chess, but you like fishing, you can only capture pieces, not pawns, that have

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,200
 captured your bait. Sounds very annoying. Okay so the pawns are obviously my best choices to

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:24,240
 become baits, therefore, let's push them. C6, not very aggressive. D4. D5. It's been a long time

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,600
 since I last saw a 100 rated guy that knows about the Karo-Kan opening. Taking his pawn is obviously

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,880
 not a good idea because I need as many pawns as possible to act as baits to capture his pieces.

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:47,120
 Therefore, E5. H5. Very aggressive. Bishop G5, I mean even if he plays E6 right now and blunders

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,240
 his queen, I actually still cannot take his queen because it hasn't captured any baits,

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:01:02,560
 but the point of this move is to provoke F6 that weakens his king. Bishop G4. F3. F6. Ah ha,

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,400
 I really want to go FG4 FG5 GH5 and I win a pawn, but since his bishop hasn't taken any baits yet,

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,960
 I cannot take it due to the rules. So I guess, bishop E3. I mean if he really just leaves his

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,600
 bishop there to irritate me, that will be very annoying. And he did. And not just that, he

12
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,240
 literally actively trap his own bishop for some very unknown reasons. Bishop D3. As soon as he

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:38,320
 takes my pawn, I'll call that pawn a bait and take his bishop. Knight F6. Ah ha, that blunders

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,640
 another piece, but again, I cannot take it due to the rules. This is getting really frustrating.

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:53,120
 H3. Ok now I literally 100% trapped his bishop, there is no way he'll just leave it there. Right?

16
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:03,440
 Knight E2. Now I'm sure the best plan is just to attack his king and ignore absolutely everything

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,480
 else. Queen A5 check. Ah ha, that is really good, because it removes his queen from defending his

18
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,880
 king. C3. I mean at least now we know that he'll retreat his bishop. Or not. Knight F4. Everything

19
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:27,200
 is hanging right now. Knight E4. Fun fact, that is still blundering the knight. But anyway. I'll

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,120
 take this pawn, I mean if he really takes my C pawn with his knight, I'll call that pawn a bait

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,920
 and then I can finally win a piece. Ha, that also works. Rook takes H3. My H pawn was a bait for his

22
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,400
 bishop to take, and you may ask how can a well defended pawn be a bait? Well, that is the problem

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,160
 with this challenge. You see, if defended pawns cannot be considered as baits, then how can I

24
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,840
 capture his pieces after they take my undefended free pawns, so we have no other way but to consider

25
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:07,840
 protected pawns are also baits. Bishop B4. I can see that this guy really hates his bishops.

26
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,080
 Bishop G5. Ok now this bishop is a bait to remove his central knight and my other bishop can finally

27
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,800
 see light. Or he'll go for his own plan. Knight takes is not good, because after knight takes

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,960
 knight, my knight cannot be considered as a bait, because that is an equal trade. Therefore, I'll

29
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,120
 take with pawn. Knight takes knight takes queen takes ok. Now comes the biggest decision of this

30
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:40,160
 game. Bishop D2. I'm giving this bishop away as a bait, so that I'll have my chances at taking his

31
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:50,080
 queen. He took it. Ok. First attempt. Knight C7. If his king lands on any of these dark squares,

32
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:58,880
 I can win his queen. Didn't work. How about this? F4. This unleashes a discovered attack from my

33
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,800
 rook to his queen, and as my experience said, the 100 rated guys are not going to see this.

34
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:14,720
 Perfect. Rook D3 C D4 Rook D4 Knight C6 Rook D5 Rook A D8 E6 check king F6 testosterone bishop

35
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:22,560
 C3 king E7 aha. Rook D7 check. I'm using a rook to bait another rook now, and if you say that an

36
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,240
 equal trade is not the goal when going fishing, the actual goal is to checkmate his king, not to

37
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:36,480
 trade rooks, so I'll say that this one is acceptable. Rook takes D7. Queen D7 king F8 queen G7.

38
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,880
 Checkmate. Mission, accomplished.

39
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:55,040
