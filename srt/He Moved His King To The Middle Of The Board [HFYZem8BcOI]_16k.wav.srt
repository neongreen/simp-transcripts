 100 rated chess, but your queen is blind, make sure she doesn't see any of your opponent's pieces

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:16,640
 or pawns. Too easy! We get a2,2,6 from Brazil. The plan is simple. If I don't push any of these

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,640
 pawns, my queen won't see anything, and if my queen doesn't see anything, she doesn't see my

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:32,800
 opponent's stuff. Knight f3, a5. I really want to push e4 to stop rook a6. But of course, I need to

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:45,200
 control myself. g3, b5. Very aggressive. Bishop g2, rook a6. I can proudly say, that only on this

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:54,560
 channel do you see people safely develop their rooks like this. Knight c3, c6. Ha, he lifted his

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:02,640
 rook, and then use his pawn to block his rook's way. But anyway. d3. I know pushing center pawns

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,200
 is very risky, but as you can see, my queen still doesn't see anything much comparing to the past.

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:18,960
 And I mean, I don't think he can do anything to open this file up either. d5, bishop f4. Knight

10
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:26,000
 d7. Okay, it's actually really hard to develop my rooks with the center closed down like this,

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,600
 so I guess I can only play with these 4 pieces. Therefore, knight d4. I know it blunders a piece

12
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,480
 to e5, but I have to do something before he can end my video, and I don't think that he can see e5.

13
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:50,800
 b4. Actually, somehow I think that b4 is actually even better than e5. Knight takes c6. Let's

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:02:03,520
 sacrifice a piece. Rook takes. Knight takes d5. a4. That blunders a pawn. Queen a5. That blunders

15
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,240
 a rook, but a rook for bishop trade is not good enough for me at this point. Therefore, bishop d2.

16
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,920
 Rook e6. Knight d5. And in no world do you take my pawn or my bishop here.

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:30,400
 Yes! That blunders a queen. Royal family fork. King d8 is forced. Oh, wait. If I take his queen,

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,560
 there is a chance that he will get crazy and go rook takes e2 ends the video.

19
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,400
 Nah. I'm just worrying too much. Knight takes b5.

20
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:55,200
 Knight c5. That blunders a rook. Bishop a5 check. King d7. Very aggressive. Bishop h3. Of course,

21
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:06,000
 in no world do you take my d-pawn here. f5. That blunders a pawn. Bishop a6. I'll take the rook.

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:19,200
 King takes. Knight c7 check. King d6. Knight takes a6. Knight takes a6. Alright, now since I only

23
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:29,440
 have a bishop left, let's try to get the rooks out. H4. Let's go this way. e5. Ha! Finally,

24
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:39,200
 he decides to develop his e-pawn. H5. King d5. Wow. I mean I understand that he wants to help

25
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:50,160
 his pawn move to e5, but dude, your knight can do the same. Anyway. Rook h4. Bishop d7. Very

26
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:59,760
 aggressive. Rook e4. Knight c5. Rook c4. I mean it's still too hard to checkmate him using only

27
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,160
 these 2 pieces, but at this point, I think we can all agree, that the mission will be accomplished,

28
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:16,560
 after my opponent runs out of time. What the f-
