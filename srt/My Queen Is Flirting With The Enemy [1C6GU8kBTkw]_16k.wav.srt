00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 100 rated chess, but your queen has to stay next to an opponent's piece.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,760
 Not porn. And I don't know about you, but I think this reaction is very funny.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:20,480
 But anyway, we get a 2-43 from the US. Of course, if I lose my queen, the video ends.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,640
 E4. Yesterday's challenge resulted in a pathetic loss, but today, it will not happen again.

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,440
 D5. Of course I need to get my queen out to start the challenge.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:43,440
 E takes D5, queen takes D5. Alright. It's game on. So it's either he plays knight C3 and allows

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,720
 queen D4 fulfilling the mission, or pushes a random pawn and forces queen G2, which makes me a fool,

8
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:58,800
 for helping him ending my own video. No, that isn't fair, so let's just say,

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,000
 that the mission starts at move 5. Queen D4. Of course pulling the queen back is a coward move,

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:17,120
 which doesn't suit me at all. Knight C3. Aha! Now the mission begins. E5. Knight F3. Queen F4

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,400
 will only provoke D4 discover attack on the queen. Therefore, queen G4. I mean this move is also

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,160
 provoking knight take C5, but based on my experience, a lot of beginners are not going

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:40,080
 to see that this pawn is hanging. Ha! You see? That blunders a pawn. Oh, wait. Now if rook G1

14
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:47,920
 happens, my queen doesn't have anywhere to go, that doesn't end the video. Well, at least it

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:56,800
 doesn't end right now. Bishop D7. Queen B4. That blunders a queen. The situation may look better

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,640
 because his knight is no longer defended by his queen, but sadly, even if I take his knight,

17
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:13,280
 the video still ends. Aha! Not anymore. Bishop C5. I'm forcing rook F1 to defend his F pawn,

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,440
 or if he plays knight E4 instead, it will allow me to take on F3, because then my queen will be

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,120
 next to his knight on E4, which doesn't fail the mission, and the threat of rook G1 will be

20
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:33,680
 absolutely gone. And he doesn't play any of the above. Anyway. That blunders a checkmate in 5,

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,200
 feel free to pause the video right now to find the checkmate, while I don't give you any seconds to

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:47,280
 do so, because people skip the video, and the answer is, bishop F2 king D1 bishop A4 B3 bishop

23
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:56,480
 B3 king E2 bishop C5 king E1 queen F2 mate, or bishop F2 king E2 bishop G3 king D1 bishop A4

24
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:06,160
 B3 bishop B3 bishop C2 queen F3 mate. Of course I didn't see any of those. Bishop A4. Oh no my rook.

25
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:17,520
 Ha! Now he finally finds rook G1. But sadly, it's a little bit late. Queen takes F2. Checkmate.

26
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,280
 Mission accomplished.

27
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:35,920
