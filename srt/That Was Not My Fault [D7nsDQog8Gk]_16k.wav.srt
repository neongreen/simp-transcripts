1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 I'm better than my viewers, and even though this position looks like an absolute disaster,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,080
 a real man never backs down from challenges.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,360
 Welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers, and the viewer this time

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,640
 is a guy called Why You Read This.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,600
 Well he actually had a different name, but I guess since he knew that I'll say his

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,760
 name out, this is how he decided to play me.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,880
 C takes d5. Before the video continues, I just want to make it clear that none of us

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,840
 had any time to look at the position beforehand, and as you can also see, this position is

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,960
 extremely complicated, so please understand that it is impossible to avoid making blunders.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,860
 Rook takes d5. Ha, I mean at least there is no way my position can get any worse when

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,080
 it is already +40 for white, so there is not that much pressure on me.

12
00:00:53,080 --> 00:01:01,720
 Knight A takes c5. Ah ha. I guess it is my time to attack. Knight takes g5 check. Nothing

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:08,380
 wrong with just giving a check. Knight takes g5, ok so some of you guys may already see

14
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:14,980
 that now there is queen g4 king e4 bishop f5 checkmate in 2. But sadly, I didn't see

15
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:21,720
 that. Queen takes f2. Again, this is definitely not my fault, it is obviously the chaotic

16
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,760
 position's fault. Queen takes f2. Bishop takes f2. And as you can see, stockfish didn't

17
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:37,480
 like that move very much. Nevermind. Again with the checkmate in 2. But this time, it

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:45,520
 is a little different. Queen takes g4. King e4 is forced. Bishop f5 is checkmate in 1,

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,360
 but I'm very sorry, that I went this way instead. Again, definitely not my fault, I take no

20
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,840
 responsibility for that. Knight takes g2. I'll be honest I didn't even see that he had

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,500
 a knight over there. Queen f5 king f3 queen g4 king e4. Those moves were to buy some time

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,440
 to look at the position, but sadly, my ancient eyeballs still refuse to see this bishop standing

23
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:19,120
 here the entire game. F3 discovered check. Knight blocks. Well, at least I'll try to

24
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:32,200
 make a new woman. And at this very moment, that I knew, I f***ed up. Ha! Nevermind. And

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,440
 in this position, after we both have blundered checkmates and missing checkmates, we ultimately

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,720
 agreed to a draw. But since this game was so bad that people will get mad if I say the

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,520
 line like I normally do, so let's change it to. I'm just a little bit better than my viewers.

28
00:02:49,520 --> 00:03:04,320
