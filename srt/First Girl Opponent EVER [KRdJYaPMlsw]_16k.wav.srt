00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 I'm better than my viewers, free your loved ones.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:10,160
 Yeah. I love myself. Ladies and gentlemen and kids, it is another episode of I'm Better Than

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,880
 My Viewers, and the viewer this time is a girl, yes you heard me right. A girl, called Ragdoll

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,600
 Kitten. And she's very high rated. This bishop eyeing down my king is very annoying, so I guess

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,720
 I'll take it first. Knight a5 check. I'll take this rook. You may say that moving my king into

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,360
 her territory is a dumb idea, but since her strongest piece is all the way on the other

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:43,280
 side of the board, I believe moving my king this way is actually a safer choice. Knight b5. Aha,

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,000
 she's threatening bishop a7 discovered checkmate in 1. Bishop e6. I mean who knows, maybe she'll

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,960
 blunder her rook. Nevermind. Alright, I guess I have no other choices. Queen takes b5. I'm sorry

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:07,360
 my love, but I couldn't find anything else. She's dead. I'll take this pawn. Well, at least I have

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:18,320
 a passed pawn. Rook takes f3. Aha. That blunders a skewer. Queen takes h3. Aha. Now if I take his

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,360
 rook with my bishop, he can go queen c8 c6 queen b7 an unstoppable checkmate in 3. So I guess,

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,480
 I'll take with my horsey. You may say that I'm a fool for blundering my rook, but if you really

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:36,640
 think about it, that was just a rook trade, and if he plays queen c8 right now, I can go knight g5

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,760
 rook h7 attacking his king and controls the b7 square faster than he can checkmate me.

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:53,440
 Queen takes h1. I'll take this bishop. c5. Very aggressive. e6 king f6 rook e1 king e7 bishop h2

17
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:00,720
 queen g2 rook e5 queen h3 rook g5 queen h8 check. King c7 is blundering a very beautiful queen d8

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:08,000
 checkmate in 1, therefore, king a7. Even though that checkmate is absolutely beautiful, I cannot

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,520
 let that happen. King d6 g4 discover check bishop e5 queen d8 rook g7 king f8 e7 queen takes rook

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,440
 takes king takes aha. Even though now I have enough materials for a checkmate, I'm definitely

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:29,280
 not gonna do that stupid bishops and knight checkmate. Therefore, g5 a4 g6 c4 g7 c3. And you

22
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:39,120
 know what? I think I've changed my mind. g8 animalized. Check. King f8. Bishop d6 check.

23
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:48,880
 King e8. Knight f6 check. King d8 is forced. Knight e5. The plan is obviously knight f7 king

24
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:56,240
 c8 bishop e6 checkmate in 2, but in this very position, my opponent resigned. Which is very

25
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:03,440
 disappointing. But anyway, I'm better than my viewers.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,640
 So,

27
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,360
 you.

28
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,000
