00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 If you lose a trade, you trade. Sounds absolutely terrifying, but still doable.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,160
 We get a 100 rated guy from Spain. E4. We can never lose a trade with pawns,

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,560
 and even though A6 forces a bishop sac as it makes a losing trade for me.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,480
 I mean who plays like that anyway? Right?

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,600
 No doubt. D4. Again, pawns can never make a losing trade.

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:41,360
 E takes D4. Aha! I normally like to sac a pawn here, but that will force Q takes D7 a losing

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:51,520
 trade. Bishop D3 instead. Blocking my own queen keeps the woman safe. F6. Not very aggressive.

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:01,600
 F4. Knight H6. F5. I'll let the pawns open the way first, and then my pieces can attack his king.

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:10,240
 G6. This capture is not forced, but since I can at least make an equal trade and not a losing one,

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,880
 I'll take it. The challenge said losing trades are forced,

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,600
 but didn't say that it bans equal trades or winning ones. Bishop takes. Equal trade.

12
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:30,000
 But it's actually winning. G takes H7. I mean if he can also let this pawn change his gender,

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,880
 that will be very convenient. Queen H5 wins a bishop, but if he goes rook block instead,

14
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:48,320
 I'll have to make a losing trade. Therefore, I'll promote. King E7. Queen trade is really nice,

15
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:57,520
 but losing trade is forced. Bishop takes. Knight D2 F5 E F5. Have to say that it is getting pretty

16
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,440
 difficult as my development moves can also harm my material balance, but if he can make a bad move

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:12,640
 like moving his king forward right now, I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. Knight

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:20,640
 check. King forward again. I really want queen F3, but it may lead to a forced losing trade in

19
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,920
 the future. So I guess, queen H5 instead. I need to make sure that my queen attacks absolutely

20
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:40,640
 nothing besides his king. King F4. Very aggressive. Knight H3 queen E2. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.
