1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge after 2 captures.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:12,320
 Too easy. I will win without even a single capture. We get a 1 33 from India.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:22,480
 C3 E5. D4. Ah ha, he's provoking the first capture of the game, and since I only have 2

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:31,120
 captures to spare for this entire game, E5 is kinda forced. I mean who plays F3 anyway? Right?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:40,160
 D5. That allows bishop C5. This looks very promising.

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,760
 D6. For some very unknown reason this guy is trying his best to force a capture,

7
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,560
 and since I don't want to play a move like C6, I guess I'll allow it. And you better try to

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,160
 defend your king, or you can also distant your queen away from your king to put him in greater

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,520
 danger. First capture of the game, and it is absolutely worth it. For those of you who are

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,040
 arguing that I said I was gonna win this game without any captures, I'm very disappointed that

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:21,200
 you actually believe those words. King D1. This loses a bishop, but that is the second capture,

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,960
 which will activate the challenge, and even though I'm absolutely not scared of the challenge,

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,960
 avoiding risks is never to be underestimated. I mean this still loses my E pawn,

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,720
 but he won't be able to see a short distance backward queen move.

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,680
 That blunders a woman, but the challenge.

16
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:52,480
 You choose to honor the loss of materials by only being able to move the material

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,400
 captured before the challenge began, which means I can only move pawns.

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,040
 And this very undeveloped bishop.

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:08,880
 B6. I'm blundering my queen, but she doesn't move, so who cares anyway?

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,760
 Well it seems like my opponent cares about my queen more than I do.

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,800
 C5. This is all I can do at the moment.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:42,300
