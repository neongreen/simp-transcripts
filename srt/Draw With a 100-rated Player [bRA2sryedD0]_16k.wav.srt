 100 rated chess, but you have to offer a draw to your opponent every time you take a piece.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,520
 Or pawn. This is going to be short. We get a 1-15 from the US. Nice beard by the way.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,720
 E4. D5. Since I'll have to offer a draw every time I take something away from him,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,440
 the best plan is obviously to give him a decent amount of material advantage first,

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,560
 so that he won't accept the draw every time he gets offered.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,240
 E takes D5. C6. I'm very sorry pawns, but you need to die for the video's sake.

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:43,680
 D takes E6. E5. Another pawn sacrificed himself for the greater good.

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,000
 This pawn has traveled far enough, I need to stop it right here.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,560
 Okay. Moment of truth. Draw offer. Yes. I mean even though my opponent lost his pawn,

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:00,720
 he still has a gigantic 2 points of material advantage over me,

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,600
 so there's no way he's accepting this offer, right?

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:15,440
 Of course. But now the question is, do I take this pawn? In my opinion, the most optimal way

13
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,920
 to win this challenge is to checkmate his king while trying our best to avoid capturing too many

14
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,200
 materials, and taking his F pawn will definitely play a great role in our checkmating process.

15
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,000
 But then he may accept the draw.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,880
 You know what? I'm not a coward. Draw offer. If it's a draw, I'll draw myself naked.

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:46,160
 Ha! You wish. Bishop C5. Taking Edward is obviously a blunder, but he'll do it for sure.

18
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,400
 Edward is dead. That blunders a rook.

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,320
 G3. Now the best continuation is queen E7 check following with bishop takes H1 winning a rook.

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,440
 But since I really need my queen for an early checkmate,

21
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,600
 allowing queen E7 queen E2 forcing a women trade doesn't seem to be a good idea. So I guess,

22
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,480
 I'll just sit here for a while and wait for him to realize his blunder and resign from the game.

23
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,800
 Well, I guess that doesn't work. Bishop B5 check. Blocking with knight is creating a potential

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,960
 trade, which means a potential draw. King F8. Knight E2 will be very convenient.

25
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:39,760
 Sadly he's not a paid actor, or unpaid actor. G5. Before you jump into the comment section,

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,840
 yes I'm blundering my bishop to knight E6 king E7 knight takes E5, but for god's sake,

27
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:54,160
 he's gonna move his knight to E2 instead. Or he can just move a pawn. Queen D4. Everything

28
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:13,680
 is hanging right now. And he chose to save the horsey. Woman F2. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,120
