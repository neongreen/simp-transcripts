 100 rated chess, but you may only capture from your starting position, or opposing forces still in their starting position.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Sounds absolutely impossible, but as usual, I'm not a coward. We get a 100 rated guy from the Philippines.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 E4. I mean pushing a pawn forward means the pawn can never go back to his starting position, which means the pawn can almost never capture anything in his entire life. But who cares anyway.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Knight F6. E5. I mean I cannot take his knight, but no one said I cannot attack it.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Knight D5. C4. Keep moving baby.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Or not. That blunders a horsey, but since my C pawn is not at his starting position and this knight is also not at its starting position.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 D4.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Knight takes D4. Ah ha. Unlike last time, my queen is definitely on her starting position right now. Therefore, that blunders a horsey.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Knight B6. That once again blunders a horsey to C5 trapping the animal, but since my queen is not at her starting position, she cannot eat that knight even if he puts it right in front of her. So I guess, I have to pull her back first.

10
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 G6. This guy decided to move both of his knights out first, but I cannot say that he is good at using them.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 C5.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Knight A4. And just like last time, I can take with my woman. Man, maybe this challenge is not as hard as I imagined it would be.

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Bishop H6. That blunders a bishop, and of course, I can take it. Such an amazing unpaid actor.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Rook F8. I cannot take that rook due to the rules, but I don't even want to take it anyway.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Bishop C4.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Rook G8. It seems like he has already quit the game, so if I somehow mess up, that will be very embarrassing.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Queen B3.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 B6. That blunders a king, and since his F pawn is in his starting position, bishop takes F7.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Checkmate. Mission accomplished, but since the video is still so short, I'll answer some of your comments instead.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I can see so many checkmates for you, all caps with a yawning face. Those are actually blunders.

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Are you assuming all those pawns are male in the first place? No, but I don't have the gut to assume that they are females.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Imagine there is a guy walking down the street and then says to a random girl that she is just a pawn.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 I wonder how many slaps will he get into his face.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Codenet Picking Review.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 From random import choice actually speeds up the generation process by removing the dot operator which takes time.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Use plurals for list names or use exception equals knight and choice directions plus exception.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Just print choice and no need for an intermediate variable.

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Your permabanned.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:22,000
