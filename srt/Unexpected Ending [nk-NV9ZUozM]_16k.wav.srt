 100 rated chess, but if your opponent's move lands on an even-numbered rank,

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,240
 you move a piece. And if it's an odd-numbered rank, you move a pawn. Very challenging,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:23,440
 we get a 298 from turkey. e4. Aha, even-numbered rank, therefore, I move a piece. g4. Very

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,320
 aggressive. Knight f6, I mean now the situation is gonna be very disgusting if he keeps on moving to

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,320
 even-numbered ranks like this, but since I'm obviously attacking his e-pawn, d3 or knight c3

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:46,880
 is definitely expected to happen. Right? Well, I guess that works too. Knight back to g8. It's

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:56,800
 fine, it's not like he can keep on playing with even ranks like this forever. Ha! e5. This guy is

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:05,920
 so dead. f4. Another even rank, but this time, I have my bishop. Alright, now just play something

9
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,200
 like a4 and allow queen h4 check destroying your king. d4. Well I mean even though that blocks the

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:21,360
 view of my bishop, it is still an even-numbered rank move. Therefore, queen h4 check. King f1.

11
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,720
 Odd rank move. e takes d4. I mean now knight f3 is very dangerous as it not only attacks my queen,

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,040
 but the fact that it is an odd rank move also forces me to make a pawn move,

13
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:44,640
 which then cost me my woman. c3. Another pawn move. b takes c3. Ah ha, that blunders a king,

14
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,200
 but since that move lands on an odd-numbered rank, I have to move a pawn. Well, I mean at least since

15
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,400
 I'm threatening checkmate in one, knight f3 winning the queen is definitely not going to happen.

16
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:08,480
 Wow. That blunders a king, but just like last time, I have to move a pawn. Okay, now there are

17
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:16,320
 two situations. He takes my pawn, I checkmate him, or he takes my queen. I'm f4. But in this very

18
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,200
 position, something unexpected happened. I got a power outage. I know this may sound very weird

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,560
 to some people, but getting an unexpected power outage is actually a normal thing where I'm living

20
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,480
 in, which is to say, that I have no other choices, than to end this video right here.
