1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
 If two consecutive moves of one player are of the same vector, the video ends.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:15,080
 So in term of comparing two vectors, there are two things, called magnitude, and direction.

3
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,680
 But who cares, all you need to do, is just to watch the video, and I will show you all

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,360
 of the moves that can end the video during the game.

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,800
 We get a 2.56 from the US.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,520
 With premium membership.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,680
 E4.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:40,160
 Since the first move is E4, the video is going to end if my opponent plays D4, C4, B4, or

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,680
 any of these moves, on his next move.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,360
 Therefore, D5.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:54,120
 Of course he can still play those moves, but most people usually just take the pawn, right?

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,320
 Yes.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,280
 Queen takes D5.

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,960
 Now bishop E2 ends the video, but let's be real, no one plays like that.

15
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,400
 Right?

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,120
 Of course.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,040
 Queen back to D8.

18
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,920
 And there's no such thing like knight H3 or knight D5, right?

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,800
 Perfect.

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,800
 Now there are knight E5 and knight B5 ending the video, but sadly, the only move that can

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,440
 stop both of them is queen D5, which blunders a queen, and I don't think losing a queen

22
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,120
 like that is necessary right now.

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,920
 Therefore, knight C6.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,400
 I mean who plays knight B5 anyway.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,120
 Right?

26
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,880
 D4.

27
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,720
 Pawn moves are very scary, since there are so many of them, and their moves are pretty

28
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,160
 much always the same.

29
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,120
 Therefore, bishop G4.

30
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:00,000
 Now please go H3 to attack my bishop, or even D5 is also fine.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,120
 H3.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,920
 Yes.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,120
 If I pull my bishop back, he may decide to go D5, which ends the video.

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,720
 Therefore, bishop takes F3.

35
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:19,360
 In no world do you end my video right now.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,840
 Queen takes.

37
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,600
 Now there are queen H5 and bishop E3 ending the video, and even though queen H5 looks

38
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,480
 like a guy walking down the street without closing his zipper, bishop E3 actually looks

39
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,200
 very natural.

40
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,520
 Therefore, knight takes D5.

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,840
 Go back to D1 please.

42
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,680
 And the best thing is, after queen D3 or queen D1, there is actually no move that can end

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,560
 the video.

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,320
 What the f-

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,080

46
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,920
