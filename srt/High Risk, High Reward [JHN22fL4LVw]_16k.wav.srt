 100 rated chess, but every move you make must share a letter, or number, with the previous move.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,320
 It sounds pretty challenging, but actually, I have a plan. We get a 188 from Russia,

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,760
 and as I've mentioned before, chess.com censored the Russian flag due to the Ukraine war.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:28,640
 E4. E5. For those of you who can't understand the challenge, my last move was E. 5,

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,000
 which means my next move has to consist an E or a 5, like knight E7, D5, queen E7,

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,640
 or you get the idea. Knight F3. Ah ha, now queen E7 is the only move that can protect my E pawn,

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,480
 and I don't like that at all, therefore, D5. This is called the elephant gambit,

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,600
 and as you have guessed, I know nothing about this thing.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:03,760
 E takes D4. I really want to play E4, but since my last move was D5, E4 shares no letter with D5,

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:14,800
 so I guess, queen takes D5. B3. C5. Let's be hyper-aggressive. Bishop C4. Ah ha,

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,640
 it's time to execute the plan that I had before the game begins. Now I need to move my queen to

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:30,240
 a square that has either a C, or a 5, and the only square is, queen C6. Knight takes E5. That

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:38,720
 forks my queen and my F7 pawn, but actually, I think that is a bad move. Queen takes G2. Oh,

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,480
 wait. I think that was my best move, but if he decides to check me now instead of moving his

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,880
 rook, I will have to move my king, and the moves of king E7 and king D8 actually share no letter

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:02:00,320
 with queen takes G2, which means I will be ending my own video. Ha! Nevermind. Queen back to E4

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,320
 check. My plan was very simple. I think it would be hard to just develop and play the game normally

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,840
 if I have to follow the rules, therefore, I need a piece that is strong enough to be moved over and

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,920
 over again, and as you may have guessed, it's the queen, because every time I move my queen,

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:27,120
 they all share the same word, of woman. Queen E2. Ah ha, now queen takes E2 is the best move,

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,240
 but if I trade queens, that will ruin my plan of moving the queen for the entire game,

22
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,320
 and I believe that I won't be able to last long if my queen dies either. Therefore, queen takes

23
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:44,880
 C2. Ok I obviously know that was a really bad move, but based on my experience from playing

24
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,800
 against the 100 rated players, there is a big chance that he will play queen D1 next instead

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:03:02,320
 of delivering a devastating discovered check. Ha! I told you so. Queen back to E4. Queen back to E2,

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:10,720
 queen back to C2. Queen back to D1, queen back to E4 again. Queen back to E2 again,

27
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:30,320
 and then queen back to C2. Draw by repetition. Ha! Mission, accomplished.
