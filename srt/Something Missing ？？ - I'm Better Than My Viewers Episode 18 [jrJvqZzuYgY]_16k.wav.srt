00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 I'm better than my viewers, you play as white. Well I mean I'm sure people are not gonna let

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,080
 me play black anyway. Welcome to episode 18 of I'm better than my viewers, and the challenger

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,720
 this time is a guy called Sack, with a Santa Bird profile picture. Let's take this rook first,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,760
 the goal is to keep as many pieces alive as possible after dealing with all of these guys,

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:31,120
 especially this very dangerous rook over here. And then he gave me that rook for free. I'll take it

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,200
 then, since this guy is a viewer, I'm sure we all know that he's definitely not a paid actor.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,880
 Knight D takes F2. I'll save this rook. I'm very sorry the other rook, but since that side has the

8
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:52,160
 queen already, I need to save materials on this side first. The other rook is dead. I'll take

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:01,200
 this bishop, ok I think that's all I can capture, therefore, now the game truly begins. Well,

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,000
 I guess I can still capture one more. This is actually very convenient.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Ah ha, now he finally starts his attack. Knight F4, I mean I'm down for rook H2 rook G2 rook H1

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,440
 rook G1 and then we repeat moves for a draw by repetition. Rook H8. Not very aggressive.

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,760
 King G2, at least this will prevent his rook from infiltrating my territory in the future.

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:38,080
 Bishop A3 queen D2 bishop E3 rook B1 bishop D7. And then he said. I misclicked. Well,

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,960
 it's not like I care if you misclicked anyway. Keck W. Rook takes B3 knight takes B3 queen takes

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,800
 C2. Well I mean it's still just a 2 pieces for a rook trade, which is actually not changing the

17
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,240
 situation that much, especially when I don't have much materials left to think about checkmating

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:04,160
 his king. Bishop A4. Knight B4. Apparently Stockfish didn't like my move very much,

19
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:14,160
 but who gives a fish anyway. Knight C5. Ah ha. Here we go. Queen G6 check. This king is so dead.

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:23,120
 King D8. Queen B6 check. King E8. I mean I can think about going for a repetitional draw,

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,760
 but to be honest, I think I can still try for a little bit more. Queen takes E5. I mean as long

22
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,440
 as I still have these 3 pieces on the board, I'm not worrying about not being able to checkmate him.

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:43,920
 Nevermind. Queen C8 check. Okay now I'm down for a repetitional draw. King F7 queen E6 king

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:53,440
 F8 queen F5 king E8 queen C8 king F7 queen F5 one more time and he said no. Wow. Queen G6 check.

25
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,440
 I mean it's fine, if he doesn't accept a draw, there's always a chance that he'll lose instead.

26
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,720
 King E7 queen G7 king D6 testosterone queen F6 king D7 I'll take this bishop rook C8 very

27
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:14,560
 aggressive queen E6 king D8 queen F6 king D7 queen F7 king D8 ah ha. Now he's trying to offer me a

28
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:23,520
 draw, but sadly, I'm not interested in that anymore. Knight E6 checkmate. I'm better than my viewers.

29
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:38,080
