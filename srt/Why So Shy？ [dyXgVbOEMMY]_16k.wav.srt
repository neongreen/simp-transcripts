 100 rated chess, but the queens are very shy. Make sure they don't touch any pieces.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:15,360
 Not pawns. Very challenging. In case you don't know, in the 100 rated e-low, they move their

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:23,840
 queens. A lot. E4. As you can see, both of our queens are obviously touching the other pieces,

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,320
 which is against the rules, but since this is the starting position of the game,

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,320
 there's nothing I can do about it. So let's just say, that the challenge only starts when the

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:44,480
 queens don't touch any pieces. E5. Alright. Here we go. Queen F3. Now since my queen is

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:52,320
 not touching any pieces anymore, the challenge is officially activated on my queen. Bishop C5.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,240
 Bishop C4. As long as he doesn't bring his queen out and activate the challenge,

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:05,840
 I still have total control of this game. Thank you. For those of you who are watching,

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,160
 feel free to pause the video right now to find the checkmate in 1 for white,

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,920
 while I don't give you any seconds to do so, because it was too obvious. Congratulations

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,480
 on spotting queen F7. But no, that move makes my queen touches his king and his knight,

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,760
 which is against the rules. Therefore, bishop takes F7 check. The checkmate was against the

14
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:34,960
 rules, but I mean if he can play king E7 now and totally lock down his queen,

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,560
 it will still be very convenient. Of course it doesn't happen. Knight D4 forking my queen and

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:55,360
 the C2 pawn will be very problematic. Therefore, C3. D5. That blunders a pawn. Bishop F5. Ah ha,

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,520
 now his queen is officially not touching anything, which means the challenge is now activated on both

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,760
 women. He takes F5. I mean queen D6, queen E7, or even queen D8 will end the video,

19
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:19,280
 but who plays such random moves like those anyway. Right? There we go. That blunders a horsey.

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,520
 And since I'm attacking his bishop with my pawn, there is no way he's ending my video now. Right?

21
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:32,800
 Of course. I'll take this pawn. Again, I'm attacking his rook,

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:42,400
 so in no world does he end my video now. Queen H4. Very aggressive. That blunders a rook. But do I

23
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,120
 even take it though, because now there is queen F4 ending the video, and unlike the last few moves,

24
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:58,240
 I think that this move looks very natural. You know what? I'm not gonna risk it. D3. I mean at

25
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:06,160
 least that can stop queen F4, now let's just hope that he will not blunder queen takes F2. Or that.

26
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,840
 What the f-
