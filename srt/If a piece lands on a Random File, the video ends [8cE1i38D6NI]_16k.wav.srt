1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 If a piece or a pawn lands on a randomized file, the video ends.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:15,360
 And he also suggested that I can use random.org with numbers representing the file's names

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:24,320
 respectively. No, there's no need to be so complicated. I'll build my own random generator.

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,640
 Very simple. First off, I need to tell the computer that "Hey man, in chess, there are a

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,800
 bunch of files like this." Next, I need to tell the engine to pick a random choice from those files.

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:49,200
 But then, after I run it, the computer is like "Hey man, I know you want me to have a choice

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,360
 from those files, but what do you mean by random? I don't real know that random guy you're talking

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:06,880
 about." Therefore, I need to introduce the random guy to him. And that's it. Very simple.

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:15,120
 Every time I run this program, its result will be shown right here. If my opponent lands a piece

10
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:24,800
 or a pawn on that file, the video ends. Also, let's just apply this rule to my opponent only.

11
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,480
 Because I think that if it also applies on me, that's just too difficult.

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,640
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

13
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:52,800
 We get a 200 rated from the US. Black pieces. Okay man, the first move doesn't count.

14
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,680
 Don't blame me for this, it's not like I can choose which side to play.

15
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,480
 E4. Let's run our program.

16
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:16,080
 D. Aha! So of course D3, D4, and Bishop D3 are the threats. But of course, there's no way I can

17
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:25,120
 prevent all of those. Therefore, E5. At least it prevents D4, unless he's a Danish gambit player.

18
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:42,560
 Queen H5. Very familiar. Engine runs. B. Not too bad. Knight C6. Since he's already played like

19
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:50,160
 that, the next move is definitely Bishop C4 right? I mean Bishop B5 just doesn't make any sense for

20
00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:05,360
 his queen. Yes. Engine. E. Everything is still okay. G6. Of course queen F3 right?

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,760
 Please don't go queen E2 just because that square is free.

22
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,080
 Why is he thinking for so long? This is still theory.

23
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:32,080
 Thank god. The dude used like 40 seconds on that theory move. I have a feeling that he was like

24
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:40,000
 looking at the book and then try to find where the F3 square is on the board. But anyway. Engine runs.

25
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:50,320
 C. Aha. Now knight F6 should be the best move, but doing that may provoke him to play knight C3,

26
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:57,920
 which ends the video. Therefore, queen F6. And I'm sure he'll trade.

27
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:09,600
 Please trade. Yes. I'll take that queen anyway, but let's check the engine first.

28
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:18,320
 H. Haha. There's no way an H-file move can happen right now. Knight takes F6.

29
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,880
 Knight F3. Engine says,

30
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:35,280
 E-file. Guess what? There's no E-file move that makes sense right now. Man this engine is really

31
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:43,120
 nice to me so far. But of course, my opponent has never been nice to me. He may even decide to take

32
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:51,280
 my E-pawn, and ends my video. Therefore, D6. Better be safe than sorry.

33
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,600
 Knight G5. Engine.

34
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:09,840
 Engine. G. Thank god it didn't go G last time. Now most people will go like, H6,

35
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,800
 knight takes F7, rook H7, and then end up trading a rook and a pawn for bishop and knight.

36
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,400
 But no. I believe letting my opponent keeping his materials is the best way to continue this

37
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:32,560
 challenge, since he will have more choices to make. Therefore, knight D8. There's no way a

38
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:40,000
 G-file move can happen now anyway. I mean just take a look at the G-pawn. If he really pushes

39
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,080
 his G-pawn now, that pawn is going to cry about the fact that there's a fat horsey blocking his way.

40
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,920
 Castle. Oh. Wait. Is that also a G-file move?

41
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:02,320
 Bruh. What the f-

42
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:16,800
