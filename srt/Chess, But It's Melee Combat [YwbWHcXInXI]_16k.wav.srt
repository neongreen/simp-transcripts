1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 100 rated chess, but all captures have to be within 1 square radius.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,500
 Diagonal counts.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:16,400
 Well, this is too hard, so I guess we also need to say, knights captures are fine.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,600
 Actually, even after exempting the knights, I still can't see there is any way for me

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,180
 to accomplish this.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:29,800
 But anyway, we get a 2 34 from the US.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,280
 G4.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,760
 Very aggressive.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,480
 D5.

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,080
 Bishop G2.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,560
 Ah ha!

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,000
 The grob gambit.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,500
 Normally, I would have taken this pawn without thinking anything much.

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,560
 But of course, that is too far away.

15
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,240
 So I guess.

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,640
 E5.

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,280
 E4.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,200
 Again, very, aggressive.

19
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,800
 D4.

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,800
 Let's play a bit more aggressively.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,160
 H5.

22
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,520
 Bishop F3.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,400
 I really want to take this pawn, but after bishop takes, his bishop will be on an open

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,720
 diagonal, which is too easy for him to end my video.

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,600
 Therefore, knight F6.

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:29,880
 My best-case scenario would be G5, knight G4, bishop takes G4, H takes G4.

27
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,160
 Knight H3.

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:38,240
 Well, that blunders 2 pieces, which is even better than my best-case scenario.

29
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,920
 H takes G4.

30
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,080
 Bishop takes.

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,500
 I really want to go bishop takes G4, which forks his knight and his queen.

32
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,980
 But of course, that is against the rules.

33
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,940
 Knight takes G4.

34
00:01:53,940 --> 00:02:02,080
 And in no world do you take my horde.

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,360
 What the f-

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:16,920
