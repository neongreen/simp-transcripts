1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
 100 rated chess, but you are far-sighted, your pieces and pawns cannot take any pieces or pawns

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,080
 within a three-tile distance of your piece. Too easy! We get a 120 from Germany.

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,360
 e4. Since I cannot take anything within three tiles, pushing center pawns or developing a knight

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:28,000
 is not very efficient, therefore, b6. Playing the bishop on the long diagonal is definitely

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:41,760
 the best way to start this challenge. Qh5. Very aggressive. Be7. Bc4. g6. Alright, Bf7 is forcing

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,560
 Kxf7, which makes me a fool for ending my own video, but since it's obviously blundering a bishop,

7
00:00:48,560 --> 00:01:00,320
 who plays like that anyway. Right? Of course. e6. Again, Qxf7 is forcing Kxf7, which makes me a fool

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,480
 for ending my own video, but just like last time, it is obviously blundering a queen, who plays like

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:16,720
 that anyway. Right? No doubt. F5. My bishop is 4 squares away from his queen, which is longer than

10
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:26,160
 3, so why not try our luck at winning the woman? g4. Bg7. I can already see that this video is

11
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:34,000
 going in a very wrong direction. Gxf5. Nc6, there's nothing I can do about this pawn.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:44,800
 Fxe6. Qf7 is checkmate in 1, therefore, Ne5. I mean if he really goes Qf7, I technically cannot

13
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:50,160
 take his queen because the knight only travels a 2 square distance every move, but of course he's

14
00:01:50,160 --> 00:02:00,400
 not going to play it. Right? Of course. Ke7 is forced. Well, I mean at least now Qf7 is not

15
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:08,080
 forcing me to end the video anymore. Qf4. That blunders a bishop, but my knight can never take

16
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,680
 anything. So I guess, Nh6, as long as he doesn't take my knight right here, I guess I can still

17
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:25,520
 bring this game back into my control. That blunders a queen, but it's only 2 squares away.

18
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:37,040
 Kf8. Qf4 check. Ke7. A repetitional draw will be very convenient. Of course it doesn't happen.

19
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:46,000
 Moving the king up is obviously way too dank. Kf8. I mean Qxd8 is forcing Rx which ends the video,

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,040
 but since he is the attacking side, of course he's not gonna trade down his strongest piece

21
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,080
 on the entire board. Right?

22
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:14,560
