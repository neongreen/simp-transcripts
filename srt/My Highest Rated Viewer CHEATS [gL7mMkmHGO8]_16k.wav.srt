 This guy made a position for I'm better than my viewers, but sadly, I have to use it for my

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,600
 viewers cheat. Welcome to the second episode of my viewers cheat. The rules are simple,

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,280
 I play normally, my viewer uses stockfish with some special restrictions, and the viewer this

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:25,200
 time is a guy called, chess simp is scared of me. Of course I'm not. G8 equals queen.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:35,120
 I mean if he gets a wife, I should also get one. Knight takes E2. Rook takes. Rook takes E5. Aha,

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,720
 so at the start of the game, I asked him to choose a number from 1 to 5, he picked 3,

7
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:49,440
 and since it is already 3 moves, I'll disable stockfish. Bishop takes E5. Knight's E3. I'll

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,400
 take this rook. My queen is just way too passive, there's no reason to keep her anymore. Knight

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:05,280
 takes D1. I'll take this knight. And as soon as I lost my queen, he gets a harem. I'll take this

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:15,600
 pawn. 3 moves have passed, stockfish enabled. Queen G7. Alright. Here we go. Bishop D5. I'm

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,120
 basically asking him, do you want to trade a queen for 3 bishops, which 2 of them actually

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:27,600
 control the same color squares. And he does. Bishop takes queen takes rook locks queen takes

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,200
 D5. Rook D2. Knight takes rook takes. I mean if he can also sacrifice his queen right now,

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:44,320
 that will be very convenient. Well, rook takes. To be clear, only my opponent and you guys get

15
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:52,880
 to see stockfish lines, I myself actually censored it on my computer. Trust. Knight takes B2. And at

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,600
 this point of the game, I chose to go for, rook takes B2. As you can see, stockfish didn't like

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,800
 that move very much, and the game shifted from my winning position, to a draw. Knight takes B2

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:14,880
 again. I'll take this knight first. F pawn changes gender. Bishop C6, I actually forgot that these

19
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:24,240
 pawns go this way. Knight D3. I'll take it, I have no idea what that was for. King B8. He wants to

20
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:32,000
 promote his A pawn, so I'll take his B pawn. Queen C5 rook B3 queen D4 rook B2, and since my viewers

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,680
 don't want me to skip the moves, I'll play them real fast. Queen C3. Rook C7 king D4 rook C3 king

22
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:50,400
 C3 bishop H5, draw by insufficient material. Ha! My viewer cheats, but he still couldn't beat me.

23
00:02:50,400 --> 00:03:04,760
