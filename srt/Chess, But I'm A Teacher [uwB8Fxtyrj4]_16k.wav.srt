1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 100 rated chess, but I need to teach my opponent how to on pass out.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,880
 Okay.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,080
 We get a 100 rated from Ireland.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,940
 With premiumed membership.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,160
 So in order to teach him the French move, I think I need to make the move first, and

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,360
 then I will give him a chance to do the move.

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,880
 Therefore, F4.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,160
 The most pushed pawn on the chessboard has to be the E pawn, so I'm planning to go F5,

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,680
 E4, on pass out.

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,280
 Also, pushing F4 first can also prevent him from playing E5 too early, since it's just

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,000
 blundering a pawn.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,120
 Well, I guess it doesn't prevent the move then.

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,960
 Now F5 doesn't have much meaning anymore, since I don't think he's going to play G5

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,800
 any time soon.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,880
 Therefore, F takes E5.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,680
 Now please play D5, or even F5 is also good.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,000
 Bishop C5.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,640
 Aha!

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,320
 Now I can tell that this guy is actually a smurf.

20
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,680
 He's tricking me into playing D4, which looks like it supports the E pawn and also kicks

21
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,440
 the bishop away, but then he'll play Qh4 check, G3, and Qxd4.

22
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,640
 Therefore, Nf3.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,120
 Getting a smurf opponent is actually really good, since there's a big chance that he's

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,520
 already known about the on pass out.

25
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,880
 Okay he's not a smurf.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,000
 Kxf2 is forced.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 D5.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,160
 Yes!

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,760
 On pass out.

30
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,600
 Ah, that feels good.

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,500
 Cxd6.

32
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,520
 Now that I have taught him about the move, it's time to let him do it himself, and since

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,200
 his pawns are so far away, let's go for, King E3.

34
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,920
 I'll use my king as a bait to lure his pawns forward.

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,760
 Bishop G4.

36
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,080
 That's not a pawn move.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,320
 Knight C3.

38
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,680
 I don't want to move my pawns, since every time a pawn moves, that pawn cannot be on

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,160
 pass outed anymore.

40
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,840
 Queen E7.

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,000
 King F2.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,240
 Dude!

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,560
 Please move your pawns, your queen is useless here as long as I still have this many pieces

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,480
 on the board.

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,400
 G6.

46
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,100
 Yes!

47
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,360
 That is not much of a progress, but it is still some progress.

48
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,720
 King G3.

49
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:55,120
 Here, please play F5 to defend your bishop, or even H5 is kinda ok too.

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,280
 Queen E5 check.

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,080
 That blunders a queen.

52
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,140
 And the best thing is, after he takes my knight, his pawn is a bit closer to delivering the

53
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,520
 French move.

54
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,760
 Perfect.

55
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,000
 King F2.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,540
 I'm not attacking your bishop anymore.

57
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,840
 Now just go F5, then E4, or maybe just go E4 right away, and I promise that I will not

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,840
 take your pawn.

59
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,520
 Oh.

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,040
 Right.

61
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,640
 I forgot that he can resign too.

62
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,640
 Oh well.

63
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:51,760
