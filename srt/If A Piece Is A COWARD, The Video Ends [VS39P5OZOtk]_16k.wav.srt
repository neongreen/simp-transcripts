1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 If a piece, not pawn, moves only one square, the video ends.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,560
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,040
 Sure.

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,540
 I think I've already made a pawn only version of this challenge, so a piece only version

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,480
 is also great.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,200
 We get a 294 from the US.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,520
 E4.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:30,020
 Ha ha, the best thing about this mission, is that even Magnus Carlsen cannot end my

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,840
 video on his first move.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,440
 D5.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,720
 Ah ha.

12
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,920
 Very tricky.

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,840
 It seems like taking the pawn is a good choice, because queen takes D4 is not a one square

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,240
 move, but actually, after he takes my pawn, he may be tempted to check me, and all of

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,280
 those checking move can end my video.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,360
 Therefore, knight F3.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,140
 Knight moves are good, since they never end the video, and leaving a target for him to

18
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,520
 capture is also a great way to keep the video alive.

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,640
 D takes E4.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,200
 Knight G5.

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,560
 Once again, pawns don't count, so D takes E4 doesn't end the video.

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,240
 F6.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,720
 I'll take the pawn back.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
 Bishop F5.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
 Ah ha.

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:29,240
 It's pretty obvious that I cannot just leave the knight there, since bishop takes will

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,720
 end the video, so another popular move has to be knight G3, which counterattacks the

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,240
 bishop, but then he'll go bishop G6, which also ends the video.

29
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
 Therefore, knight C3.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,440
 H5.

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:50,040
 It looks like he wants to play rook H6.

32
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
 So I guess.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,600
 D4.

34
00:01:52,600 --> 00:02:03,600
 And in no world do you play rook H7, just because H6 is no longer available.

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,700
 Bishop takes C2.

36
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,520
 That blunders a bishop, but queen takes blunders the video.

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:17,600
 And if I move my queen away, he may decide to take my knight, which also ends the video.

38
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,080
 So instead of blundering the bishop, this is actually a bishop fork to end the video.

39
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,800
 Are you serious?

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,000
 Alright.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,640
 I only see one way to solve this problem.

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,540
 Queen takes H5.

43
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,520
 I'll sacrifice my queen, so that after rook takes, I can move my knight away, and at least

44
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,280
 the video is still alive.

45
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,720
 Unless if he moves his king.

46
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
 Thank god.

47
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:57,120
 Man, I guess I'm the only person in the chess community that is happy when my queen is taken.

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,600
 Knight D2.

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,720
 I wanted to play knight A3, which provoke him to trade with his bishop, but since I'm

50
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,640
 down a lot of material, let's delay the trades for later.

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,680
 Queen takes D4.

52
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,100
 Good.

53
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,440
 Knight F3.

54
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,640
 At least now he'll have to move his queen again, and since there is only one safe square

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:29,240
 that can end the video, I can finally-

56
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,520
 What the f-

57
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:44,040
