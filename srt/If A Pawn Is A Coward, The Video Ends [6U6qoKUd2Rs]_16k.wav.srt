00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 If a pawn only moves one square in its first move, the video ends.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Okay then. Let's find an opponent.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 We get a 163 from Germany.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 E4. It's pretty obvious that there are 8 different ways that he can end my video right now.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 But of course, there's nothing I can do about it.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 E5. Thank God.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 So in order to prevent my opponent from moving pawns one square, I need to keep him busy in every move.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 The most popular move here is knight f3.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 But sadly, he may decide to play d6, the Philidor defense, which ends the video.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 D4 is also very risky because of d6, and f4 looks like it's really good, since everyone accepts the king's gambit.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 But sadly, f4 allows queen h4 check, and since g6 ends the video, I will have to play king e2, which I don't like at all.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Therefore, b4.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Please just take it, that is a free pawn, and in no world do you play d6 now, which also blocks away your bishop's view.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Thank you. Let's continue to keep him busy.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Bishop a3. Of course you will take it, right?

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Bishop c5. That blunders a bishop.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 But should I even take it, though? Because if I take his bishop, he may decide to play d6 to attack my bishop, which ends the video.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Therefore, I guess I should play d4.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 If his bishop is attacked, he cannot move his pawns.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Bishop e7. Ah ha! I think I can take it now. And in no world do you move your pawns now.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 He takes d4. And he proves to me that he can still move his pawns. But anyway.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Bishop takes d8. Now just calm down, take my bishop, and everything is fine.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 And do not move your c-pawn, just because my bishop is attacking it.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 King takes d8.

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And he resigned.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Mission accomplished.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:41,000
