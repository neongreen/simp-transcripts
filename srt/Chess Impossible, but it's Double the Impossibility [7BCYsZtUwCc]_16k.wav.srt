1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
 Chess, but your queen acts like a second king

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,620
 Well, that doesn't sound very impossible. Does it?

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,460
 Let's see

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:17,800
 100 rated chess, but you cannot capture your opponent's or or

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,740
 horse yes or eyes

6
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:27,940
 Okay, dude, let's just say horses

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,200
 100 rated chess, but you cannot capture your opponent's horses nor you can let our horses get captured

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,920
 This also doesn't sound impossible

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,280
 Therefore

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:50,300
 100 rated chess, but I don't harm the horses and my queen sucks

11
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,600
 Yeah, that's much better let's find an opponent

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:13,600
 *music*

13
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,800
 We get a 103 from the US

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,760
 with premium membership

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,260
 Since the horses are pretty much useless. I believe I should try to stay

16
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,260
 as solid as possible

17
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,860
 g3

18
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,020
 e5 bishop g2

19
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,340
 Knight c6 b3

20
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:51,200
 Knight b4. I don't know what that knight is trying to do. But anyway bishop b2

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,220
 Knight d5

22
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,220
 That blunders a horsey

23
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:02,140
 But of course taking it is against the rules

24
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:08,260
 There's also a free pawn on here, but somehow I have a bad feeling about taking it

25
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,500
 so I guess

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
 d3

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,900
 f5 okay, I'll take the pawn

28
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,860
 Knight c3

29
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,220
 That blunders this horsey again and what the f*ck dude

30
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,980
 Now that knight is threatening my queen and my knight

31
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,580
 but I cannot take it and

32
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:39,740
 Since my queen is a second king. This is basically a check so I have to move it

33
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,460
 But if I move it now knight takes b1 destroys the mission

34
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,700
 Is this some kind of torturing

35
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:56,540
 Okay, fine queen d2 please don't take my knight

36
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,500
 Yes

37
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,900
 that move blunders the very knight again and

38
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,580
 Again taking it is not an option

39
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:12,660
 also, it's attacking my queen which equals to a check and

40
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:18,420
 Moving it up is just too risky. So I guess queen back to d1

41
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,940
 I mean, I'm fine with a repetition and I also know that so many people are going to backseat me about that move

42
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,460
 But this game doesn't look like it's going well for me. So I need to take the risk, okay?

43
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,420
 Bishop before check this is so frustrating

44
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,340
 c3

45
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,860
 Man, he's so gonna go knight c3 again

46
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,360
 Bishop takes oh

47
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,380
 I can take that

48
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,660
 Knight takes and

49
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,700
 Here we are once again

50
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,100
 Queen c2

51
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,940
 Since he didn't take my knight last time. There's no way he's taking it this time, right?

52
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,900
 Why is he thinking for so long

53
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,620
 Knight back to d5 blundering that very night for the fourth time

54
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,420
 But anyway, I think the danger is over

55
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,900
 Knight d2

56
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,900
 It's time to strike back

57
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:31,940
 Queen e7 that blunders that horsey for the fifth time and

58
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,920
 You know, let's just block the bishops view so I won't have to see that again

59
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,780
 B5 very aggressive our castle

60
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:54,220
 Before again, very aggressive night d4

61
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:01,140
 Queen takes c2 that blunders a queen

62
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:09,780
 Mission accomplished

63
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:24,380
