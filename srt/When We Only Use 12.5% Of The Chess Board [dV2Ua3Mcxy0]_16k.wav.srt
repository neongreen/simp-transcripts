00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,500
 100 rated chess, but you must impress your Asian parents, all your achievements, which are captures, checks and checkmate, must be done on the A file.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,000
 The fact that you think that you can impress your Asian parents is already the biggest lie of the day.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 But I guess it's hard to understand for those of you who are not Asians.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 We get a 1-1-2 from India.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 An impossible challenge against an Indian, please don't expect much from this video.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:37,500
 D4. Since I can only do things on the A file, A5. Opening up the file should be my first priority.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:45,500
 Bf4. This has to be my first time seeing a 100 rated player plays the London system.

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,000
 Nf6.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 C4. Here comes our first chance.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 A4. The plan is very simple.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 QxA4, RxA4, resignation.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
 Maybe not yet.

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 E6. Trust me, this move will come sooner or later.

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,000
 Or now.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 That blunders a woman.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Ha, now all we have to do is to wait for a resignation.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Nd2. Qe7.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,500
 Bd3. Qb4. Moving more pieces closer to the A file.

19
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,500
 Rd1. That blunders a pawn.

20
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,000
 Nf3. That blunders another pawn, but since it is not on the A file.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 B6. I mean as long as he doesn't castle his king all the way to the other side, there is nothing to be worried about.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Fw1. Qa5 c5 Bxa6 Rb1. That blunders a bishop with a fork on the rooks, but since the bishop is not on the A file.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 B5. I'll block my own bishop so I don't have to see that fork.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 B4. Qa3 Rb3 Qa4.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,500
 Ng5. That blunders the other horsey, but once again since it is not on the A file.

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,500
 I cannot take it. It's fine, all we have to do is to wait for a chance at a backrang checkmate.

27
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:23,500
 Rfb1. Bp7. Just a random move, I really don't know what I have to do anymore.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Bxh7. That blunders a piece after Bg5 Bg5 Rh7, but once again, the rules ruled out all the fun.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 E4. That blunders another bishop, and I'm too tired to talk about that.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,500
 Nc3. I mean if he can go Ra1 which blunders a very easy to see checkmate in 13, that will be very convenient.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,500
 Of course he's not a paid actor.

32
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:59,500
 Ra1. Still no checkmate yet, but I'm too hopeless right now to think of something else.

33
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:13,000
 Bxc7. And as soon as I think there is no checkmate, he decided to blunder Rb1 Rc1 Rc1 Nf1 Rf1 sacrificing the Rd1 checkmate in 4.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,500
 But I cannot do that. Nc6.

35
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,500
 Bp5. Ha! F6. Get forked and resign please. Or not.

36
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,000
 E5. After he takes this pawn, I can go Nd4.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,500
 Or he can use his knight to prevent Nd4.

38
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:43,000
 There is once again a very easy to see checkmate in 19 in this position, and since everyone can see it, there's no need to pause the video to think.

39
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:51,500
 Kf7 De5 Ra1 e6 Ke8 e5 Qa2. Please at least take this rook and give me some hope.

40
00:03:51,500 --> 00:04:01,000
 You know what? There is no way I can win this game, I'm just gonna end the video right here. Have a nice day.

41
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:15,500
