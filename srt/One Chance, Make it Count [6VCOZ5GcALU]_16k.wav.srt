1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 100 rated chess, but once your pieces move forward, they can only go backward for the

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,480
 rest of the game. This has to be the number 1 challenging challenge ever happened on this

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,320
 channel, and of course, I'm not a coward, we get a 100 rated from Honduras.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:23,360
 Knight c3, the pawns are obviously not affected by the rules, therefore, let's push them.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,880
 Knight f3. Knight c6. Well I mean if he really takes Edward now, this horsey actually cannot

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:39,760
 take back due to the rules, but who plays like that anyway. Right? No doubt. d5. Of course you

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,000
 also cannot take this pawn. Nevermind. That blunders a horsey, but if I take his horsey

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,400
 right now, my queen will be absolutely useless for the rest of the game because she will only

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,800
 be able to go backward. Therefore, I'm not gonna take it, my pieces basically only have 1 chance

10
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,760
 to go forward, so I definitely need to make it count. Knight e3. E4 should be really strong,

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,840
 but I don't want to trade queens in this game since my horses are absolutely useless. Therefore,

12
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,080
 f4. I'll kick this knight away for bishop g4, and I mean if he plays knight g4 to give me his knight

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,920
 for free with an extra tempo, that will be very convenient. I'll take it, well I mean just

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,360
 blundering a horsey cannot be considered as a paid actor, so there's no need to swear anything here.

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:39,520
 h3. I'll go back this way. g4. Very aggressive. French move, I mean if he can just play a random

16
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,320
 move and let my very strong f-pawn ally to attack his king, that will help me a lot.

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:54,000
 Wow. I can't believe that actually happened. That blunders a horsey, but of course I cannot take it

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,520
 due to the rules, and if I check his king now, king takes queen h4 king g2 will be very annoying

19
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,360
 because I don't have any tools to attack his king on a light square. Therefore, bishop c5.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:16,160
 Knight takes useless horsey. Aha. Here we go. G takes f2 check. King d2 is forced. Alright,

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,440
 now there should be some sort of sketchy checkmate around here, I'll spend some time here to find it.

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:33,600
 Aha. I found nothing. Let's take this horsey then. Queen g5 was not a good move due to the rules,

23
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,400
 and the only way that I found to checkmate his king is that he'll play d4 right here to blunder

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,840
 queen takes d4 checkmate in one, but of course such convenient thing can never happen in real life.

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,000
 I solemnly swear that this guy is not a paid actor.

26
00:02:50,880 --> 00:03:07,280
 But anyway, queen takes d4, checkmate. Mission accomplished.

27
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,860
 (upbeat music)

28
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,120
 (upbeat music)
