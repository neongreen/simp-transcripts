1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 I'm better than my viewers, well at least I'm pretty sure I'm better than the Jerome Gambit players.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,640
 Gentlemen and ladies and pride people, welcome to another I'm better than my viewers video,

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,960
 and today's challenger is one of my strongest viewers, Antti.

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,600
 Bishop e4 check is too dangerous, I'll eliminate that first.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,840
 Queen takes d5. Free woman.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,760
 Another woman jumps in. Rook blocks.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:39,120
 Queen d3. Aha! Chess guide, if your opponent has an exposed king, check him until he pins his own piece.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,040
 Therefore, check check check check check check.

9
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,120
 Bishop c5. Check.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,840
 e4. I'll simplify a little bit.

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,360
 Rook f5.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,360
 Queen a6. That forces me to simplify more, and of course, I'm not a coward.

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,200
 Rook f4. And Stockfish didn't like that move very much.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,240
 Queen a takes c6. That knight is pretty much unsavable at this point.

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,920
 Knight b6 check. I'm spending one move just to distract his queen away from the center.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,400
 Horse E is dead. I have 3 rooks afk in the back, let's get them in.

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,440
 Queen check. King over.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,280
 Queen takes rook takes queen takes rook takes queen takes rook takes queen takes.

19
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,800
 Rook takes.

20
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:40,160
 King b3. Rook e7 is blundering queen d6 forking my king and my rook.

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:43,760
 Therefore, rook f4. Queen h5 check.

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,360
 Bishop blocks.

23
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,880
 Queen e2 check. King h3. No more checks.

24
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,200
 c4. Aha! He's baiting me to take his pawn aiming for a trade,

25
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,000
 but then he will actually take my pawn and go for a repetitional check or trade his queen for

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,640
 2 rooks and go for a draw of bishop vs pawn endgame. Therefore, I'll take this pawn instead.

27
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,680
 At this point even Magnus Carlsen cannot win this game as black against me,

28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
 but we still shuffled our pieces around for the next 20 moves,

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
 which are a lot of moves to edit so I skipped it instead.

30
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,080
 Rook check. King over. Rook check. Ladder check mate.

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,960
 I'm better than my viewers.

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:41,760
