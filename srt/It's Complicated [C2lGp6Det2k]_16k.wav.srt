00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 100 rated chess, but every time your opponent blunders... a piece, not pawn.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,800
 You counter blunder back with the same valued piece.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,240
 This is going to be annoying. We get a 181 from Catalonia.

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,160
 I actually have seen this idea multiple times, but even though it sounds really fun,

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,800
 I just can't find a way to make it works.

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,120
 E4. Well, if he doesn't blunder anything in the first place, I won't have to blunder back. Right?

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,120
 Knight c6. Very solid.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,480
 D4.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
 E5.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,680
 D5.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,240
 Oh, wait. Maybe I shouldn't have attacked his knight.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,200
 Yeah I totally shouldn't have attacked his knight.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,120
 That blunders a horsey. But you know, since I can't really take his knight yet,

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,760
 I don't have to blunder back. Right?

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,200
 C3.

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,840
 Knight b5.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,440
 Okay, now I can finally take his knight, so I have to blunder something back.

18
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,600
 Bishop f4.

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,800
 Now I guess after he takes my bishop, I can take his knight, and it's just a trade.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,160
 Or not.

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,520
 Wow. Now what do I do?

22
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,360
 You see, this is the problem of the challenge. Is that a blunder or not?

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,880
 You know what? I will consider it as a blunder, because since he didn't retreat his knight,

24
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,560
 he is still blundering his knight, which means I have to, still blundering my bishop.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,240
 Therefore, bishop take c5, just taking a free pawn, and by the way, that was actually a

26
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,840
 brilliant move, so it's technically not a blunder. But you know, as long as I don't

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,280
 play the line after that, it's not a brilliant move anymore.

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,920
 F take c5.

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:08,080
 Ah ha, now queen h5 check is obviously the best move, but since g6 blocking is blundering a rook,

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,600
 and I cannot blunder my rook back, that move makes me a fool, for ending my own video.

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,200
 Therefore, I'll take this knight instead.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,200
 Knight f6. Knight f3. Knight take c4, knight take c5.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:36,000
 A6. Ah ha. That once again, blunders a rook to queen h5 check g6 knight takes g6 h takes g6

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,560
 queen takes h8. But again, I cannot blunder my rook back, so that move is not possible.

35
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,360
 So I guess, queen f3.

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,440
 H takes b5. That blunders a king, but I mean, I cannot blunder my king back.

37
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,200
 Oh well.

38
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:11,680
