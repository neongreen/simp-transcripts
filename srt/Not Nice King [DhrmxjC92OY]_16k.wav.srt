 100 rated chess, but your king is h***. He needs to capture the opponent's queen himself before the

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:18,400
 game ends. Pretty complicated, but I have a plan. We get a 1 61 from Tunisia. D4. E5. In order to

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,640
 take his queen, I need to open the way for his queen. It's lit. Knight c6. A casual England

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,960
 gambit to bring my queen out, and if he sees me bring my queen out, he'll also bring his queen out.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:43,520
 Knight f3. Queen e7. Bishop g5. Queen b4 check. There usually is a bishop on f4,

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,480
 but since his bishop is not attacked right now, big chance he'll make a mistake.

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,800
 There we go. That blunders a pawn. Knight d2. Another free pawn. I've been taking a lot of

8
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,400
 pawns, it is time that he wants to trigger a queen trade, which I definitely won't agree to,

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:12,240
 but I will manage to bring his queen out of her bedroom. Or not. Queen a5 then. I guess I'll have

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,920
 to take a few more things before that woman wants to leave her husband. E3. Knight takes knight takes

11
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:28,320
 queen takes. Knight c4. That blunders a bishop. I mean who resigns just because of a bishop anyway.

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:39,200
 Right? That is correct. Another pawn dead. The only way to stop a queen is to use your own queen.

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,440
 Well? I mean offering a draw is also an option, but that usually won't work.

14
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:56,400
 Maybe I was going a bit too far with my captures, but since the video is still so short,

15
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,240
 I'll answer some comments instead. How can you be this much better than somebody who is as good as

16
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:09,120
 you, smiley face? I mean I'm better than my viewers, but some viewers are equal to me,

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,840
 so that happens everywhere. Send this to Gotham Chess for a guess the elo episode.

 No he probably won't do that. The paid actor getting a paid actor to make himself look like

19
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,920
 a paid actor. Welcome to my channel.
