1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 100 rated chess, but you're a master of intimidation, you make your opponent resign without taking any pieces.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,500
 Not pawns.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,000
 Let's go, we get an exact 100 rated American.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 E4, the plan is very simple. If I cannot take his pieces, I'll take his pawns.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 And then he gave me a free pawn on move 1. I'll take it.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Man, this has to be the most convenient start for a video in this entire channel.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 C6. I'll go back this way.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 E5. Knight F3.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 F6. Ah ha. You know what? I'll take a risk. Knight takes E5.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 To be clear, that was actually a blunder because he has queen A5 forking 2 pieces,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 but that move is very hard to see, and there is also a chance that he may take back with his pawn,

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 which blunders queen H5 queen E5 a very strong continuation for me.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Exactly as planned. Queen H5 check. I mean he should be able to see,

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 that G6 is just blundering queen takes E5 check queen takes H8 winning a rook,

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 so advancing the king forward should be the way to go here.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Of course. If you don't believe me, king E7 is best. I'll take this pawn.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 King F7 is forced. Bishop E3 check. I mean I technically cannot checkmate him

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 because the challenge requires him to resign, but if he can just go king G6 blundering

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 a very easy to see checkmate in 11, I can still only make 10 moves and let him resign

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 before I make the final blow.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 D5. I'll take it. C5. D6 discovered check. In no world do you block with your bishop now.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Are you serious? That blunders queen take C6 checkmate in 1,

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 but since I'm not allowed to take his pieces or deliver a checkmate.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 C4. I don't want my bishop dead, so I had to block away the Mexican standoff.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Bishop D6. Queen E2. H5. That blunders a rook fork to queen F3 check,

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 but since I cannot take his rook for real. D4. Opening up this bishop first.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 C takes D4. Queen F3 check. Bishop blocks. Man, between an amazing queen block

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 and the best knight block, he went for the bishop block. C5 discovered check.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 King E8. I can't think of anything. H4. Like the grandmasters always do,

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 if you don't know what to do, move your flank pawn 2 squares forward.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And it worked. No, wait. Abandoned.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 So is this a win or a loss? What kind of situation is this?

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 What the f-

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:15,000
