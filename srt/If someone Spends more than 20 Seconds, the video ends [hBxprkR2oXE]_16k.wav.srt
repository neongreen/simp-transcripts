1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 If someone spends more than 20 seconds on a single move,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 the video ends.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 No sacrificing allowed.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Well, normally, I don't take challenges that depend on pure luck.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 But of course, I can't argue with money.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Therefore, let's find an opponent.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 We get a 1-13 from Mexico.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 E4.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Very standards.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 So in order to stop my opponent from spending too much time,

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 I believe I should be playing as non-tactical as possible.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Therefore, E5.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 The most popular move to respond to E4.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 For those of you who are wondering about,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 how can we know how much time the player has spent for a move?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 They are written over here.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Like right now, there has only been 2 moves on the board.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 The 2.9 means white has spent 2.9 seconds on his move,

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 and 2.5 means black has spent 2.5 seconds on his move.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 With that said, if there is a number larger than 20 is written up there.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 The video ends.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 F4.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Great!

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 The king's gambit.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 As I was planning to avoid the tactical plays,

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 he took me into the most tactical opening ever existed.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 But anyway, what's done is done.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I believe the best thing I can do right now, is to not accept the gambit.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Bishop to C5.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 F takes E5.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 11 seconds.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And that blunders a rook.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Because it allows, queen H4 check, G3, queen takes E4 check,

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 forking the king and the rook in the corner.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 But of course, doing that is too tactically heavy,

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 which may get my opponent into burning his own time.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 So I guess, knight C6.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Bishop C4.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 That once again, blundering queen to H4.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And you know what? Let's just block her view, so there's no more tactic for me.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Dude! Why is he thinking for so long?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 What the hell dude? Please move, just take my pawn or something.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 20.0 seconds.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Okay. So if I remember correctly, the challenge suggested,

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 that we cannot use, more than 20 seconds.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 And as far as I can see, 20.0, is not larger, than 20.

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Man! The people are so going to argue with me about the decimal numbers after that number 0.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 But anyway. I have decided, that the video, survives.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 G6.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Since he has played queen H5 check, he should have expected G6 already,

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 so there's no way he's spending too much time now, right?

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Why is he still thinking?

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Dude! You saw queen H5, there is no reason you didn't see G6?

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 What the f...

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Thanks for watching!

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 See you next time!
