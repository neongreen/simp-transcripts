1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
 If a queen lands on the A file, you do a Q N A. For example, queen A6 means doing a Q N A with 6

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,760
 questions. Plot twist, I cannot take my opponent's queen, because it will make the mission too easy.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:24,240
 Let's go. We get A 100 rated from the US. Well, it's actually pretty unlucky that we got the

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:30,160
 black pieces, because I was planning to develop my pieces and go queen A1 right away as the white

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,120
 pieces. But sadly, things doesn't work like that on the other side of the board.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:47,920
 E4. The most obvious threat now is C4 and queen A4. Therefore, A5. D4. A4. Ha,

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:57,040
 now I don't have to worry about queen A4 anymore. A3. Oh, would you look at that. I was about to

8
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,680
 mention that there is also queen F3 and queen A3 threat, but now, that's not a problem anymore.

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:13,600
 E5. Since I'm so much behind in developing, gambiting a pawn should be fine. H4. I'll take

10
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:25,680
 this pawn. Queen takes. Knight C6. Rook H3. That blunders a queen, but of course, I cannot take it,

11
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:37,360
 due to the rules. B6. Queen D5. Very aggressive. Knight F6. And in no world do you play queen A5

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:47,360
 here. Rook F3. That blunders this woman again, but again, I still cannot take it. Bishop B7.

13
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,840
 Knight C3. You know what? I'll just leave a number right here, showing how many times that he

14
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:09,520
 blunders his woman in this game. Bishop C5. Bishop E3. I'll take it. F takes. Castle. Bishop C4.

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,320
 Very aggressive. Knight A5. I'm starting to feel uncomfortable for my F pawn,

16
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:24,400
 so let's try to trade down some pieces. What the hell was that? Is this guy challenging me to take

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:32,400
 his queen? King H8 is forced. Now don't tell me that he's gonna play queen G8 check, which forces

18
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:42,640
 me to take, which makes me a fool, for ending my own video. Rook G3. Wow! This guy is literally

19
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:50,080
 trying to checkmate me, while ignoring that his queen is still being attacked. G6. Somehow rook

20
00:02:50,080 --> 00:03:01,040
 G8 looks like a blunder to me, but I don't really know why. H5. D5. Oh wait! I have a knight here.

21
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:09,440
 My bad. Rook takes G6. Ha! Jokes on you, I can take these guys.

22
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:19,760
 My god, this guy is so insistent in checkmating me. Knight H5. Well, at least there's no way for

23
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:28,560
 him to end my video now. What the f-

24
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:42,960
