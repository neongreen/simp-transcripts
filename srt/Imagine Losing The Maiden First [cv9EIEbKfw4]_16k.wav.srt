00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 100 rated chess, but you want vengeance, the first type of piece your opponent takes must

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:13,920
 deliver the checkmate. Pawns count too. I mean you can just say "aww pawn". But anyway, we get a 126

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,440
 American. The most important thing is to avoid losing a pawn first because it is obviously very

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,680
 hard to checkmate with a pawn. Therefore, b3. Let's avoid pushing center pawns until a piece

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,920
 dies first. e6. Not very aggressive. Bishop b2. I mean if he can develop his bishop right now

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,600
 and blunder his rook, that will be very convenient. Why is he thinking for so long?

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,560
 Knight a6. This guy spent an entire 1 minute and 2 seconds on his clock,

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:01:02,560
 just to put a horsey on the rim. g3. b5. Very aggressive. Bishop g2. c6. Knight c3. b4. Aha,

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,840
 normally I would go knight b5 here to trick him to blunder his rook, but if he plays d5 next,

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,200
 the plan will become very unclear after knight d4, therefore, knight e4. Alright now d5 traps my

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,040
 horsey, but then I'll get to play like a normal person until my other horsey checkmates his king,

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:30,080
 and if he plays f5 instead, that will be very convenient. Well, very convenient. Knight d6

13
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,920
 check. Alright, now we have finally committed to the challenge, and after he takes my horsey,

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,640
 the other horsey must never die until it can deliver the checkmate. Bishop takes d6, bishop

15
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:51,200
 takes g7. c5. Aha, this guy is trying to confuse me by hanging both of his rooks at the same time,

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,720
 so even though taking this rook is obviously the best move, of course I have to confuse him back.

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:01,280
 Ha, now let's see if he'll try to move his rook out of the danger,

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:11,360
 or he'll play e5 trying to trap my bishop instead. Ha. Wrong move. Bishop takes a8. Knight c7 I'll

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:20,000
 go back queen e7 e4 f8. Ok. Here we go. Knight h3, this is the horsey that needs to deliver the

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:29,840
 checkmate, so in no circumstances that he is allowed to die. E3. I'll take it. E4. Queen h5

21
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:40,000
 check. King f8. Knight g5. In no world do you take this horsey right here. Of course. That blunders

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,320
 a bishop. Queen takes e5. Aha, that blunders a king to queen f7 checkmate in one, but of course,

23
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,280
 that is against the rules. Therefore, knight takes h7 check. Well I mean at least I'll get to win his

24
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:03,280
 queen. King g7. Queen takes e5 check. Of course king takes h7 will end the video, but he should

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,120
 be able to see, that king takes h7 is blundering bishop e4 check. King h6 is forced. Queen h8

26
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,720
 check. King g5 is forced and then queen h4 a very textbook checkmate in three. Right?

27
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:23,200
 I can already see, that a lot of people are gonna say oh you trash youtuber why did you

28
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,040
 throw the game you obviously did that on purpose disliked unsubbed. But anyway. What the f
