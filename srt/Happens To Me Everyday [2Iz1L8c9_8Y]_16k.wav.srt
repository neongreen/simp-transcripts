 100 rated chess, but you're drunk and now have double vision. You can move a piece. Or pawn,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,000
 only if they can currently capture an even number of pieces or pawns. Zero is even. This is 100%

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,880
 absolutely impossible, but of course, let's try it out anyway. We get a 1 1 9 from the Philippines.

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,400
 And no, I'm not mistaking it with the Czech Republic this time. My e-pawn is not attacking

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:35,280
 anything, therefore, Edward to e4. Knight c6. David to d4. I mean if he takes David right now,

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,280
 I actually cannot take back because my queen will only be attacking one piece,

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,280
 but who plays like that anyway? Right? I can already see, that this video is going to be a

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,800
 total disaster. Bishop c4. In no world do you play d5 here and win my bishop just because my e-pawn

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:03,360
 and my bishop only attack one pawn in that position. Thank you. Knight f3. This is actually

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,560
 very risky because if he plays e5 right now, my knight will be attacking one pawn and thus won't

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:17,520
 be able to move in the future. I'll castle. It's fine, it's not like I'm planning to move that

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:26,400
 knight anytime soon anyway. Knight d4. Ah ha, now my knight is attacking two targets. Therefore,

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:35,360
 I can move it. D5 is best move here, but please don't play it. Thank you. My knight is once again

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,160
 attacking two pawns at the same time. Knight takes f7. Ha, guess what, now after he's moved

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,720
 his queen, my knight will be attacking his bishop and his rook, which is two pieces,

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,800
 which means I will be able to take his rook.

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:56,080
 Unless he decides to blunder his queen just to make me unable to move my knight.

18
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:04,800
 I'm sorry I doubted you. Knight takes h8. Man, I thought this challenge was absolutely

19
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:13,440
 f***ing impossible, but I guess today is my lucky day. Queen h4. Ah ha. Very aggressive.

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
 He wants to checkmate me, and since I'm not very interested in being checkmated.

21
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,000
 G3. In no world do you take this pawn and force me to end my own video because my king is not

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:35,200
 allowed to take your queen due to the rules. No world, including this one. No doubt. That blunders

23
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,760
 a queen, and since my queen is attacking two pieces, I can take it due to the rules. Resignation.

24
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,120
 I cannot believe it. Mission accomplished.

25
00:02:49,120 --> 00:03:02,000
