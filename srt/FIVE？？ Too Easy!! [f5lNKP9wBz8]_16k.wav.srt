00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 100 rated chess, but you are schizophrenic, every 5 moves, one of your pieces, not pawns,

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,040
 must travel as far as possible to attack something that isn't there.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,720
 5 moves obviously sounds too easy, so let's change it to. 3.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,760
 Let's go, we get an exact 100 rated guy from Kazakhstan.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,120
 E4. This has to be my first ever Kazakhstani opponent on this channel,

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,320
 so I wonder what kind of rare first move is he going to make.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:38,080
 Well, not very surprising. I will have to make a long piece move on my 3rd move,

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,960
 and since bishop a6 is blundering a bishop, I definitely don't want to make that move,

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,320
 so queen h5 is my only choice, which means I have to prevent him from playing knight f6

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,800
 next controlling the h5 square. So I guess, d4. If I give him a target to capture,

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,880
 he won't develop his knight. That knight is okay, queen h5 is kinda forced.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:12,800
 Bishop e4 check. c3. Bishop a5. I'll attack this knight. Knight d4. Ah ha, that is very fancy

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,160
 taking advantage of this spin without realizing that it still blunders the knight after this fork,

14
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,320
 but since I have to make a longest possible move without capturing anything,

15
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,160
 queen d1 is kinda forced. I mean it's fine, this also prevents knight c2 from happening.

16
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,800
 Queen g5. That blunders a queen. Out of nowhere, I get a free queen.

17
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:42,000
 d6. d4. It's funny that after he retreats his bishop I still cannot take his knight due to

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,520
 the rules, but since his knight is trapped anyway, I guess there's nothing much to be worried about.

19
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,600
 Except for that. I cannot take this knight with my pawn because the challenge said not pawns,

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 I cannot take this knight with my queen because the challenge said I cannot capture.

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:07,200
 Therefore, king e2 is f***ing forced. Knight d4 check. Ah ha, he's probably hoping that I'll

22
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:15,520
 move my king back. Die. Bishop takes b4. That blunders a bishop, and I've just realized that

23
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,640
 I actually cannot take the bishop because next move is a challenger's move. c6. Bishop back to

24
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:33,120
 c1. Bishop c5. Now I can take it. Bishop g4 check. f3. Somehow I have a feeling that he's just gonna

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:44,320
 take this pawn. King e1. I don't want to explain why I didn't take it. Knight f6. I'll take this

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:53,920
 pawn. Who cares about that bishop anyway. b takes, queen takes c6 check. King f8. And now I cannot

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:03,120
 take his rook because of the challenge again. Bishop a6. Man, should have taken that bishop instead.

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,080
 Ha! Never mind. Mission accomplished.

29
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:24,400
