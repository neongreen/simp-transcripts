00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 100 rated chess, but you have to lose, while having a +10 material advantage.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:14,720
 Ha! Finally, a challenge where I can actually play like a normal person. We get a 141 from the US.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:23,120
 E4. E5. The plan is very obvious that I need to get to +10, without getting him to resign,

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,720
 and to be honest, it's pretty scary that I have absolutely no control over the second thing.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,800
 Qh5. Ah ha, that is really good, because if he gets his queen out, it is much easier for

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:45,120
 him to blunder the woman than just keeping her in her bedroom. Nc6. A4. Very aggressive.

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,960
 Nf6, I mean if he can just blunder the queen right now, that will be very convenient.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:00,480
 Of course it doesn't happen. Nd4. Alright, 8 ways to blunder your queen, just choose one of them.

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:11,520
 That's not one of them. Bc5. C3. That blunders a rook. Nb3. Well I mean if he can play Ke2 to

10
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,280
 blunder his queen instead of his rook, that will beâ€¦ nevermind. I'll take the bishop first. Qg3.

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,840
 Oh, wait. I think I have an idea. Bxf2. Since this guy has been playing so aggressively from

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,040
 the start, Qg3 is obviously to attack my g-pawn, and since my g-pawn is still undefended after the

13
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,920
 attack, I have a very strong feeling that he's just gonna take my bishop with his king and

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,640
 absolutely blunder a royal fork. Man I can already see people are gonna backseat me so bad for

15
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:56,560
 blundering a bishop if he takes with his queen now. Thank you. Nxe4. And I solemnly swear, that

16
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:06,320
 this guy is not a paid actor. Kf3. Testosterone. I'll take the woman. Alright, now I have +11

17
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,800
 material advantage, but since the challenge requires me to be +10, and as far as I can see,

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,520
 +11, is not equal to +10, therefore, I have to continue playing, instead of clicking that

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:29,280
 resign button. Kxg3. 2 pawns to go. Qf6, and I also need to be careful not to accidentally checkmate

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:38,480
 his king during the process. Nh3. d5. Man, this is actually pretty frustrating when my eyes just

21
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,360
 keep looking at his king but my brain knows for sure that I must not do anything to that guy.

22
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:54,720
 d4. That blunders a pawn. Cxd4, Qxd4. Only 1 pawn to go, and that one looks really delicious.

23
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:03,840
 Perfect. Qxb2. Okay I have +10, and even though I know clearly that the guy actually wants me

24
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,200
 to continue playing and lose by being checkmated, it wasn't said anywhere in the challenge,

25
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,280
 therefore, I'm just gonna resign here. And I'm not a coward. This is not because I don't have

26
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,920
 the confidence to blunder my king without losing any other materials in the progress,

27
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,080
 I'm just trying to take full advantage of the challenge, therefore, mission, accomplished.

28
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:40,880
