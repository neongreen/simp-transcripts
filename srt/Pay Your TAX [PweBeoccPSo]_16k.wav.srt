 100 rated chess, but your opponent is paying tax, every time the opponent captures a piece.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,440
 Or pawn, you must charge tax immediately by capturing a piece. Or pawn, that is equal or

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,600
 higher value. I haven't seen any countries that charge 100% tax on personal income. But who knows,

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,600
 maybe that'll happen somewhere in the near future. We get a 129 from a very potential country.

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:42,560
 E4. E5. Nothing wrong so far. Queen h5. Knight c6. Bishop b5. Wrong square by the way. Knight f6.

6
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,280
 Maybe he won't realize that he put his bishop on a wrong square and then blunder his woman.

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:57,680
 Of course it doesn't happen. d5. He takes d5. Aha! That blunders a woman,

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,960
 but if I take his queen right now, he can take my knight, and then I'll have to charge his tax by

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,520
 capturing something worth 3 points or more, which I definitely cannot do in that position. Therefore,

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,960
 I have to take this pawn instead. Bishop takes c6. He's just taken a 3 point piece,

11
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:29,120
 so I have to take back a 3 point piece. Queen g5. H6. Knight c3. Aha! That blunders a piece after

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:35,040
 pawn takes knight takes pawn takes, but after he takes my queen, I have to charge his tax by 9

13
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,160
 points of material, which doesn't exist on the board as I have already captured his queen at

14
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:49,440
 that point, so I obviously cannot do that. Queen e3. Bishop e4 a3 bishop a5 b4 bishop e6.

15
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:58,320
 Knight a4. Aha! That once again blunders the woman, but again, I cannot tax anything after

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,600
 he captures my bishop, so I guess, bishop d4. Ha! Now even if he moves his queen,

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,280
 I can still take his rook because nothing can take my bishop there. Exactly as planned. Bishop

18
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:22,480
 takes a1. Man that woman really dodges all of the danger. Knight c5. I'll go aggressive. Queen g4.

19
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:31,520
 F3. Queen g2 knight e2 that blunders a rook king f2 bishop d4 check king g3. In this position,

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,240
 there is a pretty hard to see checkmate in 2 that even I couldn't see during the game,

21
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,600
 so if you are interested, please feel free to pause the video to find that absolutely amazing

22
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,960
 continuation, while I don't give you any seconds to do so and I also won't tell you the answer so

23
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,680
 that you'll have to scroll down to the comment section in case you want to know. And in the game

24
00:02:51,680 --> 00:03:02,400
 I went for, h5. F4. H4. Checkmate with a pawn. Mission accomplished, and again, his queen is

25
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:18,000
 still alive.
