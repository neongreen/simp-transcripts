00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge after your 4th move.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,440
 I cannot imagine what kind of challenge this is to get a sheep reaction,

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,720
 but we'll know it soon enough. We get a 176 from Turkey.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:21,840
 E4. Since the challenge starts after my 4th move, the best plan is obviously to end the

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,600
 video within 4 moves, and convenient enough, there is an entire opening for that sole purpose.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,360
 E6. That blocks my bishop's view, so I'll change opening, king E2.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
 Bong clouding in an uncovered challenge may not sound like a very good idea,

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,200
 but since I have never done this before, it's always good to try doing everything

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,960
 at least once in our lives, as long as it doesn't break the law.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,040
 Knight F6. Pushing is too dangerous, knight C3.

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,200
 Bishop E4. D3. 4 moves have passed, I'll uncover the challenge after his move.

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,600
 Knight C6. Ok. Here we go.

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,640
 Nah, that's not a good opening, move your pieces,

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,000
 not pawns, back to their starting position and try again.

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,320
 And now we know, that bong cloud is not a good opening.

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,320
 My knight is gonna die if I don't move it soon, knight B1 is kinda forced.

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:40,320
 Knight D4 check. Optimally speaking, it would be absolutely amazing if I can move my king back and

18
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,920
 complete the challenge, but king E3 is forced. Knight back to C6. C3. Preventing this bishop

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,680
 from controlling E1. Knight G4 check. That blunders a horsey, but since I haven't finished

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,800
 the challenge yet, I don't want to move another piece as some viewers may use that as a reason

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,440
 to say that I cheated and should've failed the challenge. King E2 instead.

22
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:16,400
 Bishop C5. King back is blundering a fork. But it's fine. I mean starting a game being down a

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,920
 rook can be a little bit difficult. Nevermind. King up queen check king over.

24
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:33,360
 And he didn't blunder his queen. Free knight. Castle. Knight F3 should be really strong,

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,000
 but bishop H6 instead. Somehow I feel like he's gonna blunder something very bad very soon.

26
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,880
 F5. He takes F5. Queen takes F5 will be very convenient.

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:54,960
 Queen E1. So instead of only blundering a king like I suggested,

28
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,760
 this guy managed to lose both his king and his queen. In a single move.

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,680
 What a legend. I'll take the king.

30
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,000
 Mission accomplished.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:24,960
