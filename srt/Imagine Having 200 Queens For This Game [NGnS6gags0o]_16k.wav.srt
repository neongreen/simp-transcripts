1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
 100 rated chess, but I'll pay you 5 bucks for each point of material you have less than

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,200
 your opponent.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,080
 But you need to win.

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,000
 Another very challenging challenge.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,800
 But free money for me.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,360
 We get a 160 from Canada.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,080
 E4.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,400
 E5.

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,400
 Still theory.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,400
 D4.

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,760
 Pawns are useless, may as well just trade them for 5 dollars each.

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,640
 Plus 5 baby.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,400
 C3.

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,520
 There we go.

15
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,520
 Bishop C4.

16
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,880
 I may consider letting him queen his pawn so that he'll have an even greater material

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,480
 difference against me.

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:42,160
 But I'm still not sure if that is a good idea as I also need to win the game in order to

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,160
 get the money.

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,720
 Well, it doesn't matter if he doesn't take me.

21
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,560
 B4.

22
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,880
 Another 5 bucks.

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:57,360
 C2 royal double attack is too dangerous as I think I need my queen for an unexpected checkmate

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,400
 if I want to win this game with few materials alive, so I guess, I'll stop that pawn.

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,960
 Queen E7.

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,560
 Very aggressive.

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
 Knight A3.

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,080
 Oh no my horsey.

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,240
 Didn't work.

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,320
 Knight F3.

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,960
 I mean as long as he doesn't take with his queen and start a queen trade, I'm fine with

32
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,260
 anything that happens.

33
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,240
 Knight takes E4.

34
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,200
 Unexpected checks are very dangerous, so even though I'm obviously not a coward, I still

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,740
 need to castle.

36
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,680
 And I guess I won't sacrifice any of these pawns so I can at least keep my king safe.

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,760
 Nevermind.

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,440
 That blunders a queen, but I'm obviously not doing that.

39
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,580
 Bishop F4.

40
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,580
 Bishop C5.

41
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:49,880
 Ah ha, he's threatening a discovered check again, but since I've already castled my king,

42
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,160
 I'm not scared of it anymore.

43
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,320
 Castle.

44
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,640
 I can't believe trying to lose pieces can be this problematic.

45
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,800
 Knight D6.

46
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:07,480
 I mean if that knight gets to live until next move, I'm down to never play chess again.

47
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,960
 Thank you.

48
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,960
 Here comes a big blunder.

49
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,960
 Rook D1.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,200
 Alright, I do have faith that he's gonna see knight D1 discovered check king H1 knight

51
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,120
 F2 king G1 knight D3 discovered check again king H1 knight takes F4 giving me 40 dollars.

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
 Right?

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:33,760
 As a wise man once said, always have faith in the 100 rated players.

54
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,160
 King H1.

55
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,560
 Check again of course.

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
 Or not.

57
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,160
 Knight G5.

58
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,480
 I'm almost out of materials, so in order to be safe, let's just sacrifice this bishop

59
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,000
 and end the game immediately.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,460
 Unless he doesn't take it.

61
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,080
 This guy has just blundered his queen and his king in a single move.

62
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
 And you know what?

63
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
 I think I should breed for a little bit more.

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,680
 Bishop E5.

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,640
 My bad, mouse slipped.

66
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,920
 Thank you.

67
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,800
 Breeding for more may backfire on me as I may end up not having enough materials to

68
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,680
 win this game, so I guess, queen takes H7?

69
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,680
 Checkmate.

70
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,060
 75 dollars gained, and I'm not a coward.

71
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:33,840
