00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 If your opponent moves a piece or pawn twice in a row, the video ends.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:14,880
 And you cannot make any sacrifices. This is going to be short. We get a 127 from Australia.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:22,080
 d4. d5 ends the video, therefore, d5 is kinda forced.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:32,960
 e4. Very aggressive. Now e5 or e takes d5 ends the video. So of course, d takes e4 is kinda forced.

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:41,760
 Queen f3. Again, very aggressive. That blunders a woman. And I solemnly swear,

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,800
 that this guy is not a paid actor. Or at least, I didn't pay him.

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:57,280
 g takes f3. Aha! Here comes the hard part. Now f4 ends the video, but unlike the last few times

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,360
 where I can absolutely prevent the move from happening, I cannot 100% prevent f4 in this

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:11,280
 position. So I guess. Queen takes d4. He should be able to see, that f4 is just blundering queen

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:22,000
 e4 check knight e2 queen takes h1 winning a rook. Right? Yeah, I think he saw it. There are too many

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,880
 squares for this bishop to move to. Therefore, queen takes b2. I cannot prevent him from moving

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,480
 his bishop, so I'm trying to focus his eyes into this corner of the board, and then forget about

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:43,200
 his bishop. What the f*** was that? No. Now what am I supposed to do? Somehow I have a feeling that

14
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,280
 he's already pre-moved king e3 or something. Well, I mean if the video has to end right now,

15
00:01:51,280 --> 00:02:01,520
 I guess there's nothing else I can do. e4. Oh wait. Ha! So he didn't pre-move like I was worrying.

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:22,560
 What the f***?
