 100 rated chess, but you are trying to lose. The challenging part is that you have to lose all

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,240
 your pieces and pawns before you lose. Warning, this challenge is obviously even harder than your

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,240
 weenie every time you see your crush, so if you are expecting a win from this video, chances are,

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,760
 it's definitely going to happen. We get a 135 from the US. E4, the pawns die first.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,800
 C5. Ah ha, it's been a long time since I last saw a 100 rated guy that knows about the Sicilian

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,680
 defense. Knight F3. Quite frankly, most of my opponents so far just move their queen next.

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:51,040
 This is called, the Sicilian defense, Mon Goobse variation. Which I know absolutely nothing about.

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:03,120
 Knight C3. Queen C7. D4. I'm sorry David, but you need to die first. Or not. That blunders a queen,

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,560
 but if I take that queen, there is a big chance that he will resign from the game, therefore,

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,960
 bishop C4. Queen takes E4. That blunders the queen for the second time, but still. Bishop E3.

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,640
 Queen retreats. I'll take this pawn. Alright, since I'm not attacking his queen anymore,

12
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,680
 he should have more than enough time to move all of the other pieces. Or not. You know what?

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,320
 Queen E2. Alright, change of plan, it seems like this guy is doing some sort of challenge that

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,440
 requires him to only move his queen for the entire game, therefore, I'll let his queen

15
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,400
 infiltrate my territory and take as many pieces and pawns before it dies. Exactly as planned.

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,640
 Fun fact, that move actually still blunders the queen to rook G1. Queen H3. Bishop F7. King F7.

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,200
 Knight G5. Royal fork, or bishop F7. King D8. Knight G5. Queen F5. Long castle knight C6.

18
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,600
 Bishop E6. Queen F6. Knight E4. Queen G6. Knight F7. Check with a discovered attack on the queen,

19
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,120
 but once again, I cannot take his queen. Queen G5. That blunders the queen for I don't even know

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,600
 how many times, but sadly. Bishop D2. It's funny that David was supposed to be the first pawn to

21
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:33,040
 die, yet he still lied until this move. And he will still live. What the fu-
