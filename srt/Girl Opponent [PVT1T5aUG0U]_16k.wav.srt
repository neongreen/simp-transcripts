1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 I'm better than my viewers, kidnapped.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,720
 Disclaimer, I'm currently not kidnapping anyone.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,200
 Good morning everyone, welcome to another I'm better than my viewers video,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,360
 the series that I made to prove that I'm obviously better than my viewers,

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,040
 and the viewer this time is a girl.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,560
 Yes, a girl, called Lucy G.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,400
 E4.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,840
 The plan is very simple.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,360
 E4, E5, I win her woman.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
 Of course it cannot be that convenient.

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,480
 Bishop H4.

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,440
 Can't let her play E5 with a tempo.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,840
 E5.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,040
 The only advantage I have over my opponent is that my pieces are much more active than hers.

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,280
 Therefore, I'll open up the center.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,440
 Fun fact, D4 was actually blundering a very complicated checkmate in 9 that even Stockfish

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,280
 hasn't managed to find yet.

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,720
 So if you are interested, please feel free to pause the video right now to analyze the position,

19
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,440
 and since my 600 rated opponent can never find it on her own, or she can.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,680
 I have to take this knight, trying my best to make room for my king to move,

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,480
 and who knows, maybe she'll decide to blunder something now instead of taking my rook.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,160
 That was very convenient.

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,840
 I'll take it.

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,480
 Now she takes my rook.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,760
 This knight is too offsided, and instead of wasting some moves to bring it back to the center,

26
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,600
 I'll let it die instead.

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,480
 I mean who knows, maybe she'll take my pawn instead of my knight to give me her queen for free.

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,640
 Again, not a paid actor.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,400
 Bishop D8 King D8 Rook F8 King forward Rook B8 Knight forward Rook H8.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,240
 My opponent has just blundered her entire back rank within 4 moves.

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,720
 At least she gets my knight back.

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,480
 Rook and knight endgame, king takes C7.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,920
 If I somehow get fought here, that will be very embarrassing.

34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
 G5.

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,040
 F3.

36
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,720
 G4.

37
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,240
 Very aggressive.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,240
 Rook A8.

39
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,120
 Pawn takes pawn takes, and then she said.

40
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,480
 I want that rook so bad.

41
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,400
 You know what?

42
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
 Knight E8 check and I'll trade.

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,920
 And surprisingly enough.

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,440
 She refused.

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,160
 Knight E7 Rook A7 B4 King C6 H4 Rook takes horsey.

46
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,760
 Or I could just give you my knight, that works too.

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,840
 Yeah.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,400
 I agree.

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,560
 King F6.

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,080
 Rook vs king endgame, not much to see here, best plan is to get a queen.

51
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,680
 A6.

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,640
 And then she said.

53
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,720
 You can mate me with the rook and king you coward, smiley face.

54
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,360
 You know what?

55
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,800
 Change of plan, I'll checkmate her with a pawn instead.

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,760
 10 moves later, King B7.

57
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,960
 Stalemate.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,360
 Good game.

59
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,520
 But anyway.

60
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,320
 I'm better than my viewers.

61
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:14,880
