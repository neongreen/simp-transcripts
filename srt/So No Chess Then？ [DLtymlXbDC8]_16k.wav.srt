 100 rated chess. But simp is a pacifist, which means no checks, no captures, no attacks.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:14,000
 No. I'll just allow myself to attack, because just moving the pieces around is pretty much

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,080
 already attacking something. And with that out of the way, let's start the game.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:27,200
 We get a 100 rated from the US. E4. Since I cannot capture anything,

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:37,440
 taking center space is obviously not necessary. B6. Bishop C4. Bishop B7. Even though I'm attacking

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,280
 his E pawn, once again, we already removed the attacks part from the challenge.

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:53,120
 Queen H5. Very aggressive. G6. That's actually nice though, since I'll probably fianchetto my bishop

8
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:02,880
 anyway. Queen F3. Ah ha, he's probably thinking that after knight F6, he can go E5, which wins

9
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:11,120
 a horsey, since his queen pins my knight to my F7 pawn. Therefore, E6. Everything is still going

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:20,480
 according to plan. That blunders a queen. But I cannot take it, due to the rules.

11
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,000
 But I also cannot move my king away, due to some bigger rules.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,760
 What the f- Wait what?

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:39,200
 Ha. Mission, accomplish. But since the video is so short, I'll answer some of your comments instead.

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:47,600
 Do not get checkmated one more time. Man, this guy sounds so angry. Please just look at the

15
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,040
 thumbnail, the challenge literally required me to do so, which means I didn't really have any

16
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,920
 other choices. Simpy yells at this guy for sandbagging, even though he is a sandbag. Oh wait.

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,440
 I didn't see anything.

18
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:16,160
