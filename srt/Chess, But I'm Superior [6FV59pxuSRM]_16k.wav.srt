1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,920
 100 rated chess, but when the opponent's piece or pawn moves, simp must move any pieces or

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,440
 pawn which has the same or more value than it.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,040
 Well, that doesn't sound too hard.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,080
 We get a 185 from the US.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:26,840
 Man, there are sure a lot of Americans playing chess these days.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,120
 But anyway, before the video begins, let's make this clear.

7
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:38,360
 King is 3.5, which means it has higher value than a knight or bishop, and lower than a

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
 rook.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,640
 I know a lot of people will argue with me in the comment section, that king is infinity,

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,380
 king is zero, king is 100, king is 69, king is fat, etc.

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,000
 But who cares?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 E4, d5.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,320
 Aha!

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,800
 Now if I take his pawn, queen takes will force me to move my queen, since the queen is the

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,680
 most valuable piece, and I just don't really like to move my queen out too early.

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:19,900
 Therefore, knight f3, d takes e4, knight g5, e6.

17
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,860
 He wants to give back the pawn, but at the moment, I don't really see any reasons to

18
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,720
 take the pawn back.

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,920
 Therefore, d3.

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,200
 Oh, wait.

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,780
 I blundered.

22
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,520
 Now if he takes my knight with his queen, I won't be able to take back because I will

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,680
 have to move my queen, due to the mission's rule.

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,400
 Nah.

25
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,200
 There's no way he's going to play like that.

26
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,320
 Right?

27
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,840
 H6.

28
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,760
 Thank god.

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,720
 Knight takes e4.

30
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,760
 Let's just pull it back before weirder things happen.

31
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,120
 B6.

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,040
 Not very aggressive.

33
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,320
 Knight c3.

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,000
 Queen h4.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,680
 Very aggressive.

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,800
 Queen f3.

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,520
 Knight f6.

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,460
 That blunders a rook.

39
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,320
 Knight takes f6.

40
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,320
 Check.

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,040
 Wow.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,520
 That's a lot of testosterone right there.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,760
 Queen takes a8.

44
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,440
 King takes f6.

45
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,800
 Man.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,020
 I think NNN has been making people get more aggressive these days.

47
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,200
 But anyway.

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,200
 I want to play knight e4, which develops my knight, gives a check, and also prevent bishop

49
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,640
 c5.

50
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,680
 But sadly, since his king has more value than my knight, I guess I'll have to go with.

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,520
 Queen takes b8.

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,440
 Bishop c5.

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,920
 Very aggressive.

54
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,760
 Even though queen takes f2 is not checkmate, that move still forces me to go king d1, which

55
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,960
 is against the rules, since my king has lower value than his queen.

56
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,420
 Therefore, knight e4 check.

57
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:21,120
 And in no world do you play queen takes e4 countercheck.

58
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,000
 King f5.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,360
 Queen takes c7.

60
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,120
 E5.

61
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,720
 Queen takes f7, check.

62
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,280
 Normally, I think I should have some sort of checkmate here, but sadly, after queen

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,540
 f6, I will have to move my queen, and there is no checkmate anymore.

64
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,280
 King g4.

65
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,120
 That blunders a king.

66
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,560
 In many different ways.

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,560
 Bishop e2 is checkmate in 1, but sadly, since it has lower value than the king, we cannot

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,240
 do that.

69
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,160
 Queen f3 is also a checkmate in 1, and since a queen is higher valued than a king, it is

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,160
 legal.

71
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,680
 But, I also have.

72
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:15,920
 H3 check, queen takes h3, f3 check, king h4, and then g3, checkmate, since his queen is

73
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,000
 pinned to his king by my rook.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,760
 Not only it is a pawn checkmate, it is also a checkmate in 3, with 3 different pawn moves.

75
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,400
 And it's against the rules.

76
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:37,000
 But it's the coolest thing I've ever seen, besides Eric Rosen's on pass and mate.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 You know what?

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,320
 Who cares?

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:46,040
 H3 check, and even though I really want to show you guys the entire checkmate, sadly,

80
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,000
 since I failed the mission, the video ends here.
