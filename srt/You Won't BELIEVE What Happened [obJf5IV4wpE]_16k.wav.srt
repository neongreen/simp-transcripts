1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 If a kind of piece goes extinct, for one side, the video ends.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,920
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,600
 Let's go.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,080
 We get a 175 from Germany.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,000
 E4.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,600
 E5.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,360
 So the most dangerous things are obviously the queens, because if only one queen dies,

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,960
 the video will immediately end.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,040
 And then he decided to develop his queen first.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
 This video is going very wrong very quickly.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,720
 Knight c6.

12
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,800
 Well, technically if he really takes my pawn now, I won't be able to take back due to the

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,760
 rules, but there's no way he's gonna play like that.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,720
 Right?

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,000
 Thank god.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,520
 G6.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
 Queen g4.

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,760
 That blunders a bishop.

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,040
 D5.

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,760
 Bishop b3.

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,280
 That blunders a queen, but of course, I cannot take it, due to the rules.

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,440
 Knight f6.

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,720
 Now there's no way he doesn't see such an obvious threat.

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,160
 Are you serious?

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,920
 D4.

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,400
 Ha!

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,600
 Finally.

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,920
 D takes c3.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
 Now I have to be careful, because his other knight is invincible.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,960
 D takes c3.

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,320
 Ah ha!

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,880
 Taking his queen is obviously the best move, but actually, it makes me a fool, for ending

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,840
 my own video.

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,560
 Therefore, bishop d7.

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,800
 Queen e2.

36
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,480
 Bishop g7.

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,720
 Knight f3.

38
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,240
 Castle.

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
 And in this position, something unexpected happened.

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,200
 As you can see right here, I was playing the game with a very poor internet connection,

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,480
 and at this very moment, the white bar turned red.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,840
 And it said...

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,440
 "Reconnecting".

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,520
 That red thing lasted for about 2 minutes, and at the moment I was finally back to the

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,240
 game, I saw my opponent had castled.

46
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,920
 And my time...

47
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,360
 0.

48
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,560
 0.

49
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,840
 0.

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,920
 F*** my ISP.

51
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:34,960
 [Outro]
