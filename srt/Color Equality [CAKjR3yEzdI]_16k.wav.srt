 100 rated chess, but you move to dark squares on odd moves, or move to light squares on even moves.

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,320
 To be honest I don't think this is a very challenging challenge, but the lack of ideas

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:21,040
 is giving me no other choices. First move has to be a dark square move. D4. E5. I really want to

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:29,040
 take that pawn, but sadly, it's time for a light square move. E4. Ha, now it's a normal danish

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:40,720
 gambit. Knight F6. I'll take this pawn. Knight takes E4. Bishop C4. I'm expecting, knight C6,

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:52,960
 queen D5, F5, and I win his king. Of course it doesn't happen. Very aggressive. C3. Bishop C5.

7
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,000
 That blunders a pawn to bishop F7. King F7. Queen D5. King back to E8 and queen takes E4,

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,560
 but sadly, even though I can go bishop takes F7 now, my next move has to be a dark square move,

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:14,400
 which means I cannot go queen D5. Therefore, why not queen D5 immediately? I mean bishop F2 check

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,720
 will force me to end my own video, but he should be able to see, that after king F1, both of his

11
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,600
 pieces and his king will be under attack and there is no way to save all of them. Right?

12
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:36,560
 Ha! You see? Always have faith in the Indians. That blunders a horsey, but again, it's time for

13
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,840
 a dark square move, so bishop E3 is kinda forced. It's fine, he takes my bishop, I take his knight,

14
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,320
 everyone is happy, and in no world do you play knight takes F2 now.

15
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:56,000
 Perfect. Queen takes E4. Bishop C5. It's pretty funny that he could have played bishop all the

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:04,560
 way to C1 to be an imposter in my territory. But anyway, a dark move now. H4. I mean what else can

17
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:14,320
 I play anyway? D6. Not very aggressive. Bishop D3. And please have no idea of what I'm trying to do

18
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:23,760
 here. Bishop E6. That blunders a ko wait wait wait. I almost forgot, that it is an odd-numbered move,

19
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,760
 which means I cannot move my woman to a light square. So I guess, B4. Well, at least I can win

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:44,080
 a bishop. Ha! Noob. Queen takes H7. Checkmate. As I've predicted, the main thing is that I'm

21
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
 gonna win. The mission is quite easy.

22
00:02:46,080 --> 00:03:00,420
