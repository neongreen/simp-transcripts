 100 rated chess, but the king must capture one of every type of piece. Or pawn. Man. Is it every

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,160
 type of piece, every type of pieces, every types of piece, or every types of pieces. But anyway.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,640
 E4. E5. Since my king is the one that will have to do most of the capturings,

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,000
 I guess we have no other choices, than king E2. Let's go you mother******.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,600
 Qh4. Very aggressive. So normally I would have played knight c3 here trying to defend Edward,

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:42,400
 but since my king will ultimately have to eat his queen. D4. I'm sorry Edward, I know that you are

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,920
 very sad for continuously being sacrificed in the videos these days, but please don't be sad,

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,680
 because no one cares about you anyway. Edward is dead. Bishop E3. The plan is queen D3,

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,160
 queen takes D3, king takes D3 and we are 100% going to win this challenge, and actually if he

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,040
 can just take my bishop right now and allow king takes, that will be extremely convenient.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:15,200
 Of course it doesn't happen. Queen D3. My queen actually cannot take his queen due to the rules,

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:25,360
 so in no world you take my bishop here. No doubt. King takes D3. Ha, this guy is so dead.

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,040
 D takes E3. Aha, king takes should be the most logical move here because my king also has to

14
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,920
 capture at least one pawn. But I'll go for F takes instead, the idea is after bishop C5, I can go

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,920
 knight F3 knight D4 bishop D4 king D4 and we are one step closer to fulfilling the challenge.

16
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,520
 Exactly as planned. Knight F3. D6. Knight D4. I mean since he's up in materials,

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,560
 there is no way he's not taking my knight, and this horsey also prevents bishop F5.

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,200
 Nevermind. That blunders a bishop, but if I take it, I will be forced to capture the other bishop

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,480
 with my king, which can be a big problem for this video, not to mention that there is a chance that

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,880
 he will resign for being too disappointed in himself for losing a bishop for free.

21
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:26,720
 Nah. I'm just thinking too much. Knight takes F5, knight back to D4 again will definitely do the

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,480
 job next time, and quite frankly, who would resign a game just because they've lost a minor piece

23
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,480
 anyway, especially when they still have the material advantage.
