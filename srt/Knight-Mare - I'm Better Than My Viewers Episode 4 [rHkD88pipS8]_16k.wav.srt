00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 I'm better than my viewers, nightmare! That looks pretty annoying. Today's challenger is a guy called,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,280
 no don't do that 101, and after discussing with him, we came to a conclusion that white actually

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,160
 has the advantage in this position, which means that my opponent will be playing white,

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,960
 and I will be playing black. Rook takes a6, so you may say that I need to turn the board over so

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,840
 that the coordinates are written correctly for the black pieces, but since we don't have any

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,720
 pawns this game, I also forgot about that. I'll take this rook. The plan is simple. Move more

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:44,320
 knights towards my king, so that the horses can defend their lord. Okay, now I realize that no

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,920
 matter how many times I take on a4, there will always be another rook ready to take back that

9
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:58,880
 square. Therefore, I'll take the rook that is closest to my king. Rook takes b6, knight takes d7.

10
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:06,880
 Move them closer baby! Rook takes e8, knight takes e8. Oh wait, maybe I should have taken

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:15,520
 this rook instead. Yeah I should have done that. Knight takes a4. It's fine, let's just hope that

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,120
 he won't bring in another one. Nevermind. Wow, now he just has to take this knight and then

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:31,120
 checkmate me, and I see absolutely no way to defend it. Knight takes d6. It's fine, my opponent is

14
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,600
 actually only 700 rated, there's a chance that he won't see the checkmate plan, especially when low

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,920
 rated players are not very friendly with rooks. Ha, exactly as planned. Let's take this rook.

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,200
 Rook takes. To be honest, now I'm pretty sure that he won't see the checkmate plan, but I also don't

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,720
 have any plans myself to checkmate his king, and I think I'm also pretty bad with knights after

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:06,000
 seeing Hikaru Nakamura playing with his horses. Let's also take this rook. Man these moves are

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:15,680
 getting very random. Rook takes. This rook. Rook takes. Okay. Change of plan. Now I know that no

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,800
 matter how hard I try to get the knights closer to the king, there are some pieces that are too

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,440
 far away, which will take a lot of time to be repositioned. Therefore, knight takes g4. The

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,280
 plan will change from defending to attacking, and there can only be 2 outcomes, one is that he

23
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,400
 realize that his position is way better so he doesn't care about his king and continue to destroy

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,560
 my king, which will definitely cause me to lose. Two is that he will get scared and defend his king,

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,000
 which will at least give me a small chance to turn the table. Ah ha, he decided to defend.

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,720
 Knight takes rook. Rook takes knight. Knight takes rook. Rook takes knight. Knight takes you

27
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,280
 know what, rook takes the same thing again. Oh no, now he has officially put one hand on the

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,440
 checkmate in one. But still, there is a small chance that he won't see it. Therefore, I will

29
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,000
 not defend that knight, and go for knight takes d2. Disclaimer, I do not recommend anyone to play

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 chess like how I am doing right now, if your king is in danger, make sure you do your best to defend

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,800
 him, I'm just hopelessly trying to be better than my viewers. Ha! And it works. Of course I'll

32
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:38,480
 continue. The very first goal is to give a check into his face, and then we'll think about what to

33
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:49,040
 do next. Perfect. Here we go. Knight e3, check. Dude. It's just a check, but it feels so good

34
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,800
 like I've just checkmated him. Rook takes. Another check. And at this very moment, my opponent

35
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,760
 resigned. And just like you, I have absolutely no idea why he resigned when he has a checkmate in

36
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,080
 one that is literally unstoppable. But of course, I'm not gonna complain about it, and let's just

37
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:27,600
 say, that I'm better than my viewers.
