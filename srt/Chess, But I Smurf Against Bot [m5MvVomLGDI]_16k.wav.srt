00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 Chess, but you play against bot.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,160
 Great idea, but of course, I have to add something to make it a challenge.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,920
 Let's say, I have to win, without losing any material.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,920
 Let's go.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,200
 I chose Harry Mack as my opponent, and for anyone who don't know, Harry Mack is an artist,

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,360
 and is a participant of PogChamp 4.

7
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,120
 E4.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,560
 Since I can't afford to let any pieces die, pushing center pawns seems a bit too risky.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,040
 Therefore, knight C6.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,720
 Knight F3.

11
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,400
 B6.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,120
 Bishop C4.

13
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,320
 Bishop B7.

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,040
 Nothing wrong so far.

15
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
 Knight G5.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,120
 Oh, here it comes.

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,880
 E6.

18
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,560
 Queen H5.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
 Knight E5.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,000
 Oh, wait.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,360
 I blundered.

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:10,600
 Now he has knight takes E6, D takes E6, queen takes E5, winning a pawn, and end the video.

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,600
 My bad.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,760
 Haha, of course a 600 rated engine cannot see it.

25
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,320
 G6.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,120
 G4.

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,400
 That blunders a queen.

28
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,520
 But if I take his queen, it will turn out that I have a double attack on his knight

29
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,080
 and bishop, which may cause him to make a desperado.

30
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,400
 So I guess, I'll take the bishop.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,840
 A3.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,360
 That blunders the queen again.

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,760
 Chess.com, I believe you guys should try to fix this engine, since I don't think Mack

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,760
 is going to abandon his woman, twice.

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,920
 But again, should I even take it though, since there is also G takes H5, and even though

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,600
 that blunders the horsey, I mean he blundered his queen twice, so the horsey is nothing

37
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,080
 much.

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,640
 Yeah, I think that is still too risky.

39
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,640
 Knight F6.

40
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,760
 Alright, now there are 2 pieces attacking his queen, of course he'll move it.

41
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,160
 Right?

42
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,940
 What the f-

43
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:39,500
 (Outro music)
