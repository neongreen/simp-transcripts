 100 rated chess, but you're a bounty hunter, start off by choosing a piece.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,760
 Not pawn, you cannot capture any pieces. Not pawns, except your chosen one.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,160
 And when you do, repeat the cycle. I didn't take the fortune telling class when I was in Hogwarts.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,520
 But of course, I'm not afraid of it. We get a 100 rated guy from Malaysia.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,360
 And since I'm obviously not a coward, the first piece to choose, is definitely the queen.

6
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:42,080
 E4. A5. War-ray defense. D4. Rook A6. Aha! That blunders a rook. But sadly,

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,640
 I cannot take it before I get his queen. C4. Let's just block away my bishop so that I won't

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,880
 have to think about this. Rook D6. Free tempo, E5. I mean the situation will become pretty

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,560
 problematic if he decides to take this pawn, but who plays like that anyway? Right?

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,480
 F6. I feel like this guy is laughing so hard at my face for not being able to take his rook due

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:19,280
 to the rules, so I have to take this pawn. He takes F6. Bishop E3. The plan is very simple,

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:28,080
 bishop D3, queen H5 check, G6, bishop G6, H takes G6, queen takes G6 and he'll have to expose his

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:36,000
 king. Queen E7. My opponent saw through my entire plan and decided to pin this bishop so that bishop

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,040
 D3 will be blundering my D pawn. So I guess, knight F3. This move alone proves that this guy

15
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:51,280
 is actually a smurf and his real rating should be around 2000 points rapid. G5. As soon as I block

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,040
 away my queen, he pushed his G pawn just to annoy the fact that I can no longer play queen H5.

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:06,640
 So I guess, I'll sacrifice this knight. Bishop H6. That was a pre-move by the way. Queen H5 check.

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,480
 King D8. Knight F7 check. Ha, now he has no choice but to take my knight because he can

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,240
 obviously see that king E8 is blundering knight E6 double check king F8 knight C8 losing 8 points

20
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:29,040
 of material. Right? I cannot take any of these rooks due to the rules, but I also don't want

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,600
 knight G5 going for a repetitional draw. Knight E5 discovered check. Please just block the check

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:44,000
 with your queen. Thank you. Now that finally blunders a woman. And the next piece is obviously

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,840
 his bishop. Or resignation. Mission accomplished.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:04,480
