00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 100 rated chess, but your queen is cheating, she must always be closer to the enemy king than your own.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,500
 Net or air is never my favorite choice of anime, but chess is a different story.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,000
 We get an exact 100 rated guy from America.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 D4. There is no way I can move my queen away from my king at the moment,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 so let's just say, that the challenge starts at move 2.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 E5. Opening up the way for the queen to leave her husband, and please don't play G3 here.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Thank you.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Qh4. Alright, now the challenge truly begins.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 My queen is now 5 squares away from my king, but only a square root of 18 away from the enemy king,

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 which means she is obviously cheating.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Qd5. Very aggressive.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Ne7. I mean he should be able to see, that my knight is attacking his queen in an extremely obvious way,

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 so a move like Kd1 making the distances between my queen to both kings equal which ends the video can not be played at the moment.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Right?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Right?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Wow.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Even I didn't see that coming.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 If I take his queen, that will reduce the distance from my queen to my king down to only square root of 13,

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 which is shorter than square root of 18, which makes me a fool for ending my own video.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Therefore, Kd8 is kinda forced.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Square root of 32, square root of 18, but I can already see, that this video is going to be short.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Qe8 check.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Ha! Guess what, even if I take that queen, that won't end the video.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And still, in no world do you go Kd1 here.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 No world, including this one.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 No doubt.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 But you know what, just to be safe, Kd8.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 This way, I will never have to worry about Kd1 again.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 And no, I'm not a coward.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Bd3.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 D6.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Let's just open up the center and checkmate him real fast before something crazy happens.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Like that one.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 That blunders a bishop.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 C4.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Centralizing my queen will only make her a bigger target to be attacked,

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 which may reduce the number of safe squares far away from my king,

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 so I guess, I'll take this pawn instead.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Nc3.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Nbc6.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Game abandoned.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Mission accomplished.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:58,000
