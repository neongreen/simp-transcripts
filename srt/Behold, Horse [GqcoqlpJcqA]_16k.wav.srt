 100 rated chess, but you have wild horses. Another piece, not porn, must always be touching your

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,040
 horses. Well even though I personally don't recommend touching wild horses since you may

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:23,520
 get kicked in the face. But anyway, let's start the game. We get a 125 from Brazil. E4. E5.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,920
 Still theory. The plan is simple, I just need to keep the knights in their starting position so

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,280
 that they can always touch my rooks, which means I will not be moving any of these pieces in this

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,240
 game. D4. Since all I have is a queen and 2 bishops, I need to maximize my bishop's power,

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:50,000
 and after E D4 C3 D C3 Bishops C4 C B2 Bishop E2, I will have 2 very strong bishops eyeing

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,760
 down his kingside. Nevermind. I'll take this pawn then, well I mean opening up the bishops is also

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:07,360
 good enough. Queen takes, bishop D3. Queen F6. F4, the pawns are also very important in this game

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,240
 since I'm lacking materials, so I'll make sure to use them to their full potential. Bishops E5.

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,640
 Ah ha, he is obviously threatening to take my knight, which makes my knight die, which means

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,840
 there is no piece that can touch it anymore, because no one can touch a ghost, which means

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,560
 I'll have to end my video. Therefore, E5, I mean not E2 to let the king touch the knight was

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,160
 obviously a safer move, but he should be able to see that bishop takes G1 is blundering a woman.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:48,720
 Right? Of course. G3. Again, even though he can end my video right now, he should be able to see

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:57,520
 that taking my knight is still blundering his queen. Right? Absolutely. Okay even though I

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,200
 should really be playing knight E2 right now. F5. Again, he can end my video, but he should be able

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:14,800
 to see that it's once again just blundering his woman. Right? Okay so I think he did see the thing,

19
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,000
 but I have no idea how did he come up with this move. That blunders a woman. Ha, and even better,

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,720
 now he can't even end my video, no matter how hard he tries. Resignation. Mission accomplished.
