1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 If my opponent types in chat,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 the video ends.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Well, normally, no one chats during a game of Blitz Chess.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 But if we do this,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 every time one of my pieces,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 or pawns,

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 is taken,

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 I press F to pay respects.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 If we combine these two rules,

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 the challenge is legit.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 I have nothing else to say.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Let's find an opponent.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 We get a 300 rated from the US.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 E4.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 E5.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Still theory.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Knight F3.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Knight F6.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 The Russian opening.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So normally, I would take on E5,

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 but after D6,

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Knight F3,

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Knight takes E4 will force me to send an F in the chat,

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 which may cause my opponent to reply.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Therefore,

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Knight C3.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Knight C3.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Knight C6.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Bishop C4.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Bishop C5.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Such a peaceful game for a 100 rated match.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 I'll castle.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Castle.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 D3.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Knight G4.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Aha!

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Here we go.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 The first strange move of the game.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Bishop G5.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Bishop takes F2.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 That's a big blunder.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 He was probably thinking about danger levels.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 If you attack my queen,

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I attack your king.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 But sadly,

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 things don't work like that.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 After rook takes F2,

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Knight takes F2 counterattacking my queen,

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 King takes F2.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 If queen E8,

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I will have Knight D5,

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 with an unstoppable family fork.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Or if after king takes F2,

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Knight E7,

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Knight D5,

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 F6,

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 there is knight takes F6 double check,

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 King H8 is forced,

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 knight back to D5,

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 and then he will still at least lose a rook to a bishop.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But of course,

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 before all of that going to happen,

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 F.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Rest in peace,

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 my F-pawn.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 And let's just hope that my opponent won't reply to just a random F.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Rook takes F2.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Knight takes F2.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Of course I will take that horsey.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 But once again,

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 I will take that horsey.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 F.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I haven't even sent my second F yet.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 What the f-

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:44,000
