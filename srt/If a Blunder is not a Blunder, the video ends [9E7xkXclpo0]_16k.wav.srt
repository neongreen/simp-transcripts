1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 If a blunder of a piece, not a pawn, is not a blunder to stockfish.

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,360
 The video ends.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,680
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,000
 Well, that's easy to understand.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,600
 Let's find an opponent.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,360
 We get a 2 39 from Brazil.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,360
 D4.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,000
 D5.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,560
 Still theory.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,720
 E3.

11
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,280
 Now we're out of theory.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,960
 Bishop F5.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,040
 Queen F3.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,040
 That blunders a pawn.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,080
 But since the challenge only affects the pieces, the video is still safe.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:57,040
 Also, I'm not taking that pawn, since putting my bishop in his territory may be too tricky

17
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,360
 for him, which may lead to some blunders.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:06,120
 And since the challenge is all about the blunders, I believe the best thing to do, is to avoid

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,880
 all of the blunders in the first place.

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,680
 So I guess.

21
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
 E6.

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,720
 Knight C3.

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,920
 C6.

24
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,120
 Maybe C5 was better, but I'm just trying to keep my opponent from making blunders here.

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,120
 G4.

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,600
 Very aggressive.

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,640
 I'll go back.

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,960
 Bishop D3.

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,680
 Bishop B4.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,560
 Nothing crazy so far.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,120
 Bishop takes G6.

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,300
 H takes.

33
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,480
 Knight H3.

34
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,760
 I'll take this knight.

35
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,000
 B takes.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,880
 Knight D7.

37
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,720
 Somehow I have a feeling that something bad is about to happen.

38
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,280
 E4.

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,720
 Yeah my feeling is right.

40
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,620
 That blunders a pawn.

41
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,600
 But if I take his pawn, he may decide to take back.

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,960
 Which blunders his knight over here.

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,000
 But since we cannot know if Stockfish thinks that's a blunder or not, I think it's best

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,040
 to just totally avoid that.

45
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,760
 And F6.

46
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,320
 Knight G5.

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,400
 Again, very, aggressive.

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,780
 I'll take the pawn now.

49
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,320
 Queen F4.

50
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,320
 Ah ha!

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,960
 He's obviously baiting me to go knight D5, attacking his queen, but blundering my king

52
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,520
 in the process.

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,980
 He's so underestimating me right now.

54
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,720
 So I guess, let's throw a punch at him.

55
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,920
 Rook H4.

56
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,640
 That's not a good move, but it's tricky.

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,860
 Bishop A3.

58
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,960
 That blunders a pawn.

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:15,220
 And again, since a pawn is not a piece, there's no need to check Stockfish about it.

60
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,200
 But actually, when you really think about it, this guy has been playing really well

61
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,440
 that he hasn't blundered any pieces so far.

62
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,240
 Queen D6.

63
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,160
 Right.

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,500
 That blunders a horsey.

65
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:44,800
 But I mean, this is too obvious, so there's no way Stockfish declines it, right?

66
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,180
 What the f--

67
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:59,760
 [outro]
