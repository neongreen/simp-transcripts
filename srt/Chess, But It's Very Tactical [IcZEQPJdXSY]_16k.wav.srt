1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 100 rated chess, but I cannot capture a piece normally. It must be through some sort of tactics.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Well, if this is the case, I guess we'll have to go with... not pawn.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 This sounds very difficult, but I have a feeling that things are probably going to go well.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 We get a 154 from the US.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 d4

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 d5

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 knight c3

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 knight f6

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 So far so good.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 e4

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 That blunders a pawn.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 And once again, pawns are not included in the rules.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Bishop b5 check.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Ah ha! Now if I go bishop d7, he will probably take it, which forces me to take back, which is against the rules, since that is just a normal.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Recapture.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 The same thing also applies with knight d7 or knight c6.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Therefore, c6 is kinda forced.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Bishop a4

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 I want to push my e-pawn, but doing that may provoke bishop g5, pinning my knight to my queen, and then he may also decide to take the knight, which I cannot take back, since it's just a normal recapture, which is not very tactical.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Therefore, h6.

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Knight h3.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 I want to take his knight, but once again, that doesn't include any tactics in it, it's just a normal capture.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 So I guess, knight d7.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 f3

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 I'll take a pawn.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Knight e4.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Very aggressive.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 But anyway, that blunders a horsey.

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 But again, this doesn't include any tactics in it, so I can't really take it.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Also, if I just leave the situation like this, he may decide to take my knight, which I cannot take back, because it's just a normal recapture.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 So I guess,

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 knight to d5.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Castle.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 I'll take another pawn.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Rook f2.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Ah ha!

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Very tricky.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 He's obviously baiting me to go knight b6, double attacking his knight and his bishop. And then he'll go queen f3, saying, oh yeah, take my bishop, and I'll make your king run for his life.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Well, I actually think my king will still be okay, but let's not take the risk.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 e5.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Let's play a bit more aggressively, so that there can be more tactics happen.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 d takes e5.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Knight takes e5.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Rook f5.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 That blunders a rook. And since my bishop is having a skewer of rook and knight,

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 this capture

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 is legit.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Knight hf2.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Bishop e7.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Queen h5.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Very aggressive.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 g6.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Queen back to d1.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 I'll castle.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Queen e2.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Let's try to make a queen trade.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Queen a5.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 b3.

60
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 That blunders a bishop. But again, this is not very tactical.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 So I guess, let's stick with the queen trade plan.

62
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Queen e1 check.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Queen takes.

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Knight f3 check.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 King takes g2 is forced.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Knight takes e1.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 And since that was a royal fork, this capture is legit.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 King f1.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 Knight takes c2.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Rook b1.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Knight back to d4.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 Bishop takes h6.

73
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 Rook d8.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Knight g4.

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 That blunders a horsey, and since this is a pin, this capture

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 is legit.

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 And he resigned.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Mission, accomplished.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:56,000
