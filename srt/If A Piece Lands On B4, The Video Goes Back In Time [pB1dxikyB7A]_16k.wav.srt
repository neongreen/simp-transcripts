00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 If a piece or pawn lands on B4, the video goes back in time.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Ah ha! B4 and B4. Good joke there.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 But anyway, we get A208 from Chile.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 For those of you who are looking for the B4 square, it is right here.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 If anything lands on this square, the video ends.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 First move. The most obvious threat right now is E5, followed by bishop to B4.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Therefore, knight F3.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Well, technically, if he plays E5 right now, I will have to play things like A3 to prevent bishop B4,

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 and then he can push E4 to attack my knight, which should be really good for him.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 But let's be real. No one plays like that. Right?

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 D6. Wow! Not only he didn't open up his bishop, he also put another pawn in front of it,

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 and further disallow bishop B4.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 This video is definitely going to be very long.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 D4. Bishop D7. Not very aggressive.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 E4. C5. Ah ha!

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Now it looks kinda like a Sicilian, just with a weird bishop on D7.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 But anyway. Bishop C4. Such a peaceful game for the 100-rated ELO.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Okay no more peaceful game now.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Bishop D2. The bishop blocks the check, counterattacks on the queen, and also controls the B4 square.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 He totally deserves a pay rise.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Queen A4. Very aggressive.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Bishop B3. Please remember that your queen is still unable to go to B4.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 (The end)
