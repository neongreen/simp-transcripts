 100 rated chess, but you fight for the motherland, you must push all your pawns at least 2 spaces

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,240
 before moving any of your other pieces. It's funny that this guy wrote a challenge about spaces,

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:22,160
 but he himself forgot a space. Noob. We get a 1 57 from Indonesia. E4. The plan is very simple.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,040
 I push 8 pawns, he's fraked, or he takes a pawn before it is pushed, I'm fraked. So yeah,

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:41,280
 one of us will be fraked. E5. D4. 2 down, 6 more to go. Knight C6. Aha, now even though I can

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,360
 continue to push my pawns, I think I should take this pawn instead. This way after he recaptures,

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:55,600
 I'll have a tempo to push my F pawn. Exactly as planned. F4. I mean it will be very problematic

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,960
 if he plays knight F3 check pawn takes and queen H4 check forcing my king to move which ends the

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:10,800
 video. But who plays like that anyway? Right? No doubt. That blunders a horsey, but sadly,

10
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:17,520
 H4. Again, I cannot move any pieces before the pawns are pushed, and in no world do you take

11
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:25,200
 this pawn here. I'm worrying too much. C3. And I've just realized that bishop C5 threatening

12
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,920
 bishop F2 check forcing my king to move which ends the video is actually unstoppable.

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:39,040
 Ha! Unless it doesn't happen. B4. Completely prevent bishop C5. But not that one.

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,320
 Wow! That blunders a bishop, but of course I cannot take it yet, and it's also threatening

15
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,320
 bishop G3 check forcing my king to move and there's nothing I can do about it.

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,480
 Alright. A4. Please move your eyes to this side.

17
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:06,960
 You know what? Let's just say, that king is not a piece. King E2. The video continues,

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,960
 and I'm obviously not cheating. Knight 8 F6. These pieces are blocking my G pawn's way. King F3.

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:21,360
 Bishop E5. That bishop is threatening my C pawn, which hasn't moved 2 squares yet,

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,160
 but since that pawn is obviously defended, there's not much to be worried about. G3. I'm also trying

21
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,320
 to give him 2 choices to end my video, and as the grandmaster always say, if you have a fork,

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,400
 don't take it before they move one of those pieces. Or pawns.

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:47,680
 That bishop has just ended my video twice. What the f-

24
00:02:47,680 --> 00:03:02,160
