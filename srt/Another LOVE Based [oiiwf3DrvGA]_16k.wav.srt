00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 100 rated chess, but your pieces are soulmates, at some point of the game, your rooks must kiss

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,600
 each other, your bishops must kiss each other, and your knights must kiss each other. If any of your

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,920
 pieces get taken before they kiss, the video ends. My deepest apologies towards the maidenless viewers

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:27,360
 out there. We get a 215 from Denmark, with a very cute chihuahua profile picture. E4. E6. So in order

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:35,120
 to let the pieces kiss each other, I obviously need to open up the lines, therefore, D4. Knight H6.

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,360
 I really want to take that knight, but since my bishops haven't kissed each other yet. Bishop E3.

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,440
 The plan is very simple. Bishop E3, bishop D3, knight D2, knight E2, and we are done with the

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:01:00,560
 minor pieces. A5. Very aggressive. Bishop D3. Alright, 1 down, 2 more to go. A4. Again, very aggressive.

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:09,600
 Knight D2. A3. Too aggressive. I'll take that pawn first. I mean knight E2 would have let the knights

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:19,120
 kiss, but delaying it for 1 move can not bring any harm to the video. Right? Rook takes A3. Knight E2.

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,160
 And just like that, we're done with the minor pieces, so if he can take my bishop right now

12
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,960
 with his rook and give me 2 points of material advantage, that will be very convenient.

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:38,560
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. I'll take that rook. Knight G4. I've just

14
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,720
 realized that if he does the same thing with my other bishop, there will be 4 pawns in the

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,120
 middle of the board preventing me from moving my rooks toward each other. H4. The plan is very

16
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:58,320
 obvious. Knight takes E3. F takes E3. Man, now how am I supposed to move my rook to the other side?

17
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,640
 Queen H4 check. Ah ha, that blunders a queen, but if I take it, big chance he will immediately

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,880
 resign, and since my rooks haven't kissed each other, the mission is failed. So I guess, knight

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,280
 G3. Queen takes rook is ending the video, but he should be able to see, that my knight on G3 is

20
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:35,360
 obviously defending the rook. Right? Right? No doubt. King F1. Queen takes E3. That is actually

21
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,960
 really good, because I obviously need a path to transfer my rook over. Rook B1. Queen takes D3

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,400
 check. Blocking with the queen is best, but somehow I feel that he won't be able to see that my knight

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:57,920
 is defending my rook. Therefore, king E1. Queen takes D4. Rook lift. Queen takes E4 check. That

24
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:06,080
 blunders the queen again, but since my rooks still haven't kissed yet. King F1. B6. Rook HB3.

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:15,680
 One more move, and this guy is so dead. Queen A4. Rook 3 B2. And in this position, I've finally

26
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,400
 broken all the magical, I mean I've finally accomplished all of the challenge's goals,

27
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,160
 and if I continue playing this game, it will just be a guy smurfing in the 180 D low,

28
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,000
 which may result in an account banned. So I guess, let's just end the video right here.
