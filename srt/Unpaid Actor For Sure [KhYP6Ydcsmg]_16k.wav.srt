00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 100 rated chess, but every second move, you have to move your king in the worst way possible.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,040
 Absolutely impossible, we get a 135 from Bangladesh.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,840
 E4, okay I'm sure now the best strategy is just to not move anything around the king so that the

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,200
 king will never be able to move, but to be honest, that sounds just like what a coward is going to

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:31,760
 do, and of course, I'm not one of them. King E7 next let's go. What the f*** was that? I solemnly

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,560
 swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. King E7, now don't tell me that he's just gonna keep

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:45,840
 advancing his king. Okay good, I'll have to move my king on the 4th move, and since I obviously

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,920
 don't want him to go to the middle of the board. D6. Knight C3. King F6, I can't see any differences

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,680
 between king F6 and king E6, so I just chose a random one. D3, that threatens to skewer my royal

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,960
 couple. Therefore, H6, I mean if he still plays bishop G5 now, I actually cannot take his bishop

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,240
 because I have to move my king, which blunders a woman, but no one plays like that anyway.

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:25,040
 Right? Ha, not even close. King E6, to be honest, even though my king is in the middle of the board,

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,640
 somehow I think that he is very safe right now. Knight H4, aha, that blunders a horsey,

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,720
 but do I even take it though, because after queen H4 G3, I'll have to move my king according to the

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:47,600
 rules, which blunders a maiden. Well? I'm not a coward, now let's just hope that he'll just play

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:56,960
 a random move. Well, I'll say that that move was very random. King F6 is forced, and I've just

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,240
 realized that my queen is trapped. Ha, I mean it doesn't matter if he doesn't attack it anyway.

18
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:14,880
 Knight C6, king move and queen back coming up next. F3. King E6 is forced. B3, so the original

19
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,840
 plan was to retreat the queen, but as I can see here, queen G3 is a much better move. Queen B1.

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:29,280
 Man, I cannot understand any of these moves. King F6 is forced, I'm confident to say he's

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:39,440
 just gonna blunder his bishop next. Or his rook. Queen takes. Bishop E2. King E6. G4. Alright,

22
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,240
 even though I'm having a tremendous amount of advantage, it is still very hard to make progress

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,600
 because I cannot do anything that requires more than one move. Therefore, let's take a risk.

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,280
 Knight D4, I mean if he takes my knight right now, I cannot take back because I'll have to

25
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,320
 move the fat king. And he took it immediately. King F6. Well I mean at least that proves that

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:13,040
 he's not a paid actor, unless he decides to keep his bishop there. Well, I guess that was a mouse

27
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:23,600
 slip. Bishop D1. King E5 is forced. You know what, at this point, I only have two theories.

28
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,040
 The first one is that he's an unpaid actor, which is not true because we all know that I never get

29
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,320
 any actors into my videos. The other one is that he's actually one of my viewers and he realized

30
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:40,640
 that he is playing against me making a video, which is basically also an unpaid actor. Therefore,

31
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:54,480
 I'm not gonna play this game anymore. Draw by agreement. Mission kinda accomplished.

32
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:01,920
