 100 rated chess, but you don't follow opening principles.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,520
 Man, the idea shortage is getting really really serious.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,520
 But anyway, according to this article on chess.com by international master Daniel Wrench,

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,560
 there are a few opening principles as followed.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,160
 Develop, don't bring queen out early, get castled, and connect the rooks.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,640
 Therefore, e4, moving a pawn is definitely not following any of those principles.

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
 Knight c6. d4. Again, pawns moves are safe.

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,320
 Knight f6. e5. Ha, maybe I can actually win this game with the pawns alone.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,880
 Knight e4. Very aggressive. f3. Knight takes d4.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,600
 Ah ha, the principles said that I shouldn't bring my queen out early.

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,200
 Therefore, let's bring the queen out. And of course,

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,480
 let's just assume that developing a queen is not really a development.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,520
 Knight c3. Knight takes is best, but that is also developing my knight,

14
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,520
 which is one of the opening principles, which is against the rules.

15
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:19,760
 Therefore, I'll take with pawn. d5. The French move.

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,640
 e6. f4. Dude, if you really think about it, I guess I can only use my queen and

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,360
 pawns to checkmate him this game. e5. Pawn takes. I mean if he can just

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,640
 blunder his bishop now, that will definitely help a lot.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,880
 I solemnly swear that this guy is not an actor,

20
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:51,040
 no matter paid or unpaid. e takes d6. c takes d6. Queen takes g7.

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
 I mean it will be hard to checkmate his king when I don't have any center pawns

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,000
 left, so let's just force him to resign instead.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,120
 f5. That blunders a rook. King e7. That blunders a queen to bishop g5

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,120
 skewer the couple, but sadly, that is a developing of a move,

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,360
 which is against the rules. Therefore, I'll take this pawn instead.

26
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,920
 King e6. g4. I mean that blunders a pawn, but if somehow he doesn't take it, I can

27
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,920
 bring in another pawn into the attack. Well, that's sad.

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,680
 Queen e4 check. It's fine, now since my queen is forking his king and pawn,

29
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,440
 king f7 is expected so that his bishop can defend his pawn,

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,640
 and then there is queen h7, king e6, queen back to e4 and then we repeat

31
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,520
 moves for a draw. Nevermind. Continue checking for a draw

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,760
 may not work because queen e7 is forcing a queen trade and I cannot

33
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,920
 allow that. Therefore, c4. Let's bring in more

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,000
 materials. Queen a5 check.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,920
 c3 is kinda forced. In no world do you take this pawn.

36
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,680
 Wow! That blunders a queen, but once again,

37
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,920
 that is developing a piece. Therefore, king d1. It's fine, at least now his

38
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,080
 queen is not defending his king anymore, I will have more chance of getting a

39
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,600
 draw. Queen takes a1. Queen h7 check.

40
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,960
 King c6. Queen e4 check. c5. That should be really bad. Queen takes

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,360
 c5 check. King c7. Bishop f4 is 100% leading to

42
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,840
 some checkmates, but sadly, c5.

43
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:54,000
 c6. Wow! I can't believe I actually did it. That blunders a king. Queen d6 check.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,600
 King b7 is forced and then c6. Checkmate with a pawn.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:05,520
 Mission accomplished.

46
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:18,320
