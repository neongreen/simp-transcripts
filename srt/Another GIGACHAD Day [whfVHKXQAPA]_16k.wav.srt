 100 rated chess, but you are very aggressive, you must attack your opponent at all cost,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,480
 and you cannot make passive or defensive moves. Yeah. Very aggressive. Well I mean there is

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,080
 absolutely no way I can make a move that attacks anything in this position, so let's just say,

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:26,560
 that the first move, doesn't count. E4. E5. Alright, now the challenge officially begins.

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:36,000
 D4. My David is attacking his E pawn, which is very aggressive. D5. Ah ha, now I really want to

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,760
 take his E pawn, but that move doesn't make my D pawn attack anything, which is against the rules,

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,240
 so I guess. F4. Surprisingly enough, this is actually still a book move, and this is a very

8
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,840
 famous opening called the King's Gambit declined, Fault be a Henriksen Gambit. Yeah, I definitely

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:03,360
 know everything about this opening. Knight F6, F takes E5, attacking his knight is definitely a

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:12,160
 good choice. Knight takes E4. Ah ha, now there is a very dangerous threat of queen H4 G3 knight G3

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:18,320
 H G3 queen H1, and even though normally I would have played knight F3 here, that move actually

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,480
 doesn't attack anything, therefore, queen F3 is kinda forced. At least this move attacks his

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,720
 horsey and his F pawn, and even if queen H4 happens right now, G3 will also be attacking his queen.

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:40,720
 Knight G5. I'll take it. Queen takes, queen C1 is very dangerous, therefore, knight C3.

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:50,160
 Queen takes E5. Wow. I didn't even see that. That blunders a woman, but if I take it,

16
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,760
 that move actually doesn't attack anything, which is against the rules. I also cannot move my king

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:01,120
 or block with another piece because those moves also don't attack anything. Therefore, I have to

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:07,040
 block with queen. And the worst thing is, now since his queen is pinned to his king, he'll most likely

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,440
 just gonna take my queen, and then I'll have to end my own video. This game sucks.

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:23,760
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. D takes E5. I mean not only he didn't end

21
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,200
 my video, but he also gave me the right to take his queen with my pawn, but please trust me,

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:39,120
 this guy is 100% not a paid actor. Trust. Bishop takes E5, queen takes E5 check. A check always

23
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,640
 follows the rules, because it obviously attacks the king. King F8. Knight takes D5, I'm threatening

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,040
 queen E7 king G8 queen E A checkmate in 2, so if he can blunder it right now, that will be very

25
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:02,400
 convenient. Ha! You see, this move definitely proves that he's not a paid actor. Queen takes C7.

26
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:10,720
 And then for some reason he moved his knight away. Queen E7 check, and I can pre-move. Queen E8

27
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,920
 checkmate. Mission accomplished, and once again, he's not a paid actor.

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:32,400
