00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 Chess, but it's a normal game at your normal elo, if you lose you reveal your elo.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,480
 You must be new to the channel, because people who have been watching me from the beginning

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,880
 they all know what my rating is.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,240
 But still, it's good to make a video about it.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,480
 We get a guy from Italy.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,480
 D4.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,960
 Knight F6.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,800
 Maybe a London system against King's Indian game.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,280
 B4.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,800
 Very aggressive.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,840
 That move doesn't control the center, therefore, I'll reclaim the center.

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,160
 He is now one move behind me in development, so I'll go for a reversed London system myself.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,680
 Knight C3 Bishop F5 E3 E6 Knight F3.

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,760
 Ah ha, he's gambitting this pawn so that he can have a half open B file to attack me,

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,360
 and even though it looks really dangerous, I'm not a coward.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,780
 Bishop D2.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,360
 B1 will be very annoying.

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,640
 Bishop A5.

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,840
 Knight A4.

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,540
 I don't want to trade with his bad bishop.

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,000
 Bishop B6.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,960
 Bishop E5 check.

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,880
 C6.

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,080
 Bishop back to E2 again.

25
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,040
 Knight BD7.

26
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,120
 C4.

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:24,880
 He starts a center break when none of us has castled yet, so I have to play more aggressively.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,240
 Bishop B4.

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,040
 He's trying to stop me from castling so that a center play will be more dangerous toward

30
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,760
 my king, so I guess, Bishop C7.

31
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,320
 Of course I don't want to lose my bishop against an offsided knight when I have to fight in

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,400
 the center.

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,840
 And then somehow he decided to allow me to castle again.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,600
 You know what, since he wants me to castle, I'll move my queen instead.

35
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,360
 Ha, I'll make him think I want to castle the other way, when there is absolutely no world

36
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,400
 where I'll be doing that.

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,800
 Rook B1.

38
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,840
 Queen G5 may get knight H4 which is very annoying, H5.

39
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,360
 H4 queen G6 coming.

40
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
 Nevermind.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
 B5.

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,280
 Knight move I'll fork.

43
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,280
 On passan my rook gets an open file.

44
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
 Knight B2.

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,400
 That blunders a fork.

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,520
 Knight C3.

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,080
 Queen C2.

48
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,520
 Bishop A5.

49
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,920
 Before you decide to comment that I suck at chess by missing a free queen, I just want

50
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,120
 to tell you that my brain wasn't capable of thinking that my opponent will be blundering

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,440
 his queen like that, that doesn't happen a lot, so I'll say that wasn't my fault, but

52
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,920
 more like the challenge give us fault.

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,300
 Queen C1.

54
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,280
 Knight A2 is winning a queen, but I'll take this rook instead.

55
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,920
 I can also win a bishop after this rook.

56
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,080
 And in this position, my opponent resigned, I cannot show you the resignation screen because

57
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,000
 it exposes my elo, have a great day.

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:12,620
