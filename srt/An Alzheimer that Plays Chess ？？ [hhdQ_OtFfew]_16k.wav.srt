 100 rated chess, but you have Alzheimer. Every 5th move, you must move 1 piece, or pawn,

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,280
 back to its original location,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:19,280
 because you don't remember moving it there. Let's go. We get a 177 from the US.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,400
 d4. e5. I mean the pawns can never go back to their original square,

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,680
 but since we still have 4 moves to go until move 5, there's nothing to be worried about.

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:45,520
 c3. Not very aggressive. d5. knight f3. e4. Okay, that is 3 moves in, which means my next move has

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,080
 to be a piece move, and then I'll have to bring that exact piece back to the original square the

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:58,240
 move after. knight e5. Bishop d6. In no world do you just go crazy and take this pawn just

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:07,200
 because I'll have to move my bishop back. Of course. That blunders a horsey, but sadly,

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:16,160
 bishop f8 is forced. Bishop f4. Aha! Now that really blunders a horsey. I mean if he can also

11
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:25,440
 blunder his queen, that will be very convenient. Of course that doesn't happen. Bishop f5. Provoking

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:33,920
 g4 weakening his king is definitely a great idea. Knight d2. Bishop d6 bishop d6 queen d6.

13
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:45,680
 Alright, one of these moves coming up next. g4. It's the bishop then. f takes e4. Bishop takes g4.

14
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,760
 I mean if he can play h3 right now to blunder queen g3 checkmate in one, that will be very

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:02:02,640
 convenient. I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. Queen g3. Checkmate. Mission

16
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,240
 accomplished, but since the video is still so short, I'll answer some of your comments instead.

17
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,480
 A lesson learned. Being a coward is much better than being an idiot. Ha! Coward. Since you

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,000
 achieved a better position in the video but still lost, I would argue your argument to be invalid.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,360
 Well, I'm better than my viewers.

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,860
 I'll see you next time.
