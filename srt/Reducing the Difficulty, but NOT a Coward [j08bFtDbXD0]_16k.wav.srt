00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 100 rated chess, but the enemy king has covid, you must remain at least 6 squares away from him at

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,480
 all time. So in case you have never played chess before but still want to suggest your idea,

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:22,480
 1 2 3 4 5 6, 1 2 3 4 5 6, 1 2 3 4 5 6, and as you can see, 6 squares from the king is basically my

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:30,160
 second rank, which is to say, that I can never move anything. So I guess, we can just change it to

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:39,360
 4. Let's go. We get a 1 78 from Mexico. E 4, this is the furthest point I can go this game,

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,760
 so I guess let's just try to open up the board so that the bishops can use their power.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:54,960
 E 5. D 4. In no world do you advance your king and end my video on move 2. No doubt. It's actually

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,360
 pretty problematic when he doesn't want to take my pawn, so I guess, I'll continue to push. If I

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:08,960
 create more weaknesses, maybe he'll play a bit more risky. Knight F 6. Bishop D 3. The fact that

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,840
 he is very resistant to invade in my territory is actually very problematic for this video. Ha!

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:25,440
 Here he comes. Knight F 3. D 5. Very aggressive. He's about to fork my pieces, therefore, I'll

12
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,640
 attack his piece first. D takes E 4. I'll take this bishop, I mean who knows, maybe he'll take

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,320
 this pawn instead of one of these pieces. And he did. I'll take this pawn then. Bishop B 4 check.

14
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,400
 C 3. I mean if he can also blunder his bishop right here where I can still take it,

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:54,480
 that will be very convenient. I solemnly swear, and I know that you people won't believe it anyway,

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:02,960
 but I still have to say it, that this guy is not a paid actor. C takes B 4. Knight E 3. Too

17
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,680
 dangerous, I have to take that. D takes. Trading queens in this challenge is definitely the

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:17,920
 stupidest I can do. Queen E 2. Knight C 6. Queen takes E 3. I'll sacrifice this pawn just to get

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:27,840
 his knight into my territory. He took it. Knight C 3. Come on, knight C 2 triple fork. He saw my

20
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,080
 bishop. That blunder's bishop takes F 7 a very simple and easy to see checkmate in 11, but since

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,920
 that move is obviously against the rules. King F 2. My favorite way of connecting the rooks.

22
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,680
 Rook E 8. Rook A D 1. This pin is actually a bit dangerous because I'm very limited in using

23
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:56,720
 tactics, but of course, I'm not a coward. Knight D 5. That blunders a horsey, but queen C 1 instead.

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,680
 In no world do you take this knight right now just because my rook cannot take your queen due

25
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,760
 to the rules. Or that pawn. That blunders a woman, but I can only take this knight.

26
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,480
 Rook sacrifice. Queen takes. Queen H 4 check. I can also take that, even though this guy has

27
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,440
 been playing like an absolute paid actor, the fact that he's not resigning is actually pretty

28
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,720
 concerning. Nevermind. Mission accomplished.
