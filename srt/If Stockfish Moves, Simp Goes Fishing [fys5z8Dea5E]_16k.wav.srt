1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 If Stockfish sees a 1.0 material advantage...

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,100
 or more...

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,100
 Simp goes fishing.

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,100
 Yeah, Stockfish ends my video, but another fish has to die.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,600
 Disclaimer.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,600
 I only use Stockfish to analyze my game after it is already done, which means I didn't cheat during the game.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,100
 I know most people know about this, but I still want to say it out loud,

8
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,100
 since there are always some haters who just want to ruin my video coming in and say,

9
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,100
 "Oh you trash YouTuber you cheat during the game disliked unsubbed."

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,100
 And with that out of the way, let's start the game.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,100
 We get a 219 from the US.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:50,100
 Man, that is like my 69th American opponent in a row, and chess.com has been invaded by the US.

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:58,100
 But anyway, since I have to keep the game as balanced as possible, I think I have to go with a less aggressive opening.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,100
 d4.

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:10,100
 Yeah, you see? White starts at +0.5 advantage, but after d4, it's just a dead... draw.

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,100
 d5.

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,100
 Still theory.

18
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:21,100
 Bg4 is really scary, since it allows me to kick his bishop around, which may cause Stockfish to dislike it,

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:28,100
 but a preventing move like f3 or h3 is even riskier, since I may end up ending my own video.

20
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,100
 Therefore, let's just follow my own plan.

21
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,100
 Bf4.

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,100
 Wow.

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,100
 0.00000000.

24
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:44,100
 This video is definitely going to be long.

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,100
 Nc6.

26
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:53,100
 Aha, I was worrying that he might have played Bg4, but this is actually perfect.

27
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,100
 e3.

28
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:01,100
 Now Bg4 is no longer available.

29
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,100
 At least I think so.

30
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,100
 My god that was scary.

31
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,100
 Nf3.

32
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:23,100
 Now that you have developed your bishop, please don't move it again to pin my knight, since I'm pretty positive that it ends the video.

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,100
 Well, I actually don't think we even need to check Stockfish about that move.

34
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:35,100
 And since I'm being quarantined due to covid-19, let's just end the video instead.

35
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:50,100
 Thanks for watching.
