1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but if there are more than 40 possible moves you can make...

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,760
 The video ends.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,360
 I'm sure there are already some people saying that changing 27 to 40 is too much of a negotiation,

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,840
 but please trust me, 40 is an absolutely fair number, and you will see the reason during

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,220
 the game.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,320
 But anyway, for a challenge like this, I think I should be picking a longer time control

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,880
 like 10 minutes, or even 15 minutes so that I can count the moves before making a decision.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,740
 But no, that is a coward act.

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,520
 I will play 3 minute splits.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
 Let's go.

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,560
 I will use my instinct and strategies to beat this challenge, without even needing to count

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,640
 the moves.

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,680
 We get a 1 56 from Peru.

14
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,760
 With a very fat cat profile picture.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,960
 E4.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
 First move.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,080
 We have 16, plus 4, is 20 different moves.

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,560
 Which is less than 40.

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,960
 Knight C6.

20
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,480
 Knight C3.

21
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,200
 22.

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,640
 Knight F6.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,560
 Please remember that even though there is a number right here showing how many different

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,680
 moves there are, I did not have that during the game, so I'm literally playing the game

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,100
 blindly and trying to be safe as much as possible.

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,640
 Knight F3.

27
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,160
 You see, just by developing the knights already brought the number to 24, so 27 was obviously

28
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,160
 a bad idea.

29
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,580
 But anyway.

30
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,280
 Here comes the serious stuff.

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,900
 D6.

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,640
 The plan is simple.

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,160
 All I have to do, is to trade down the pieces, and if there are only pawns and kings on the

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,080
 board, the video can never end.

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,760
 Bishop E2.

36
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,800
 Bishop G4.

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800
 Castle.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 Dude.

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:01,320
 It's already at 35 when I've only developed a bishop.

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,320
 But of course, I didn't know that during the game.

41
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,600
 Let's trade it down real fast.

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,520
 Perfect.

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,480
 One down, a lot more to go.

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
 Knight E5.

45
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,920
 I mean it's right there for me to trade, so why not.

46
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,760
 D4.

47
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,720
 Thank you.

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,000
 Queen takes.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,200
 Ah ha.

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,280
 Since he got his queen out, this is a very good chance to trade down my queen.

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
 E5.

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,720
 I have to be careful though, because once I take my queen out, the video is immediately

53
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,360
 put at risk.

54
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,280
 D takes E5.

55
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,340
 Taking back that pawn will open up this massive file for my queen and also this very long

56
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:51,000
 diagonal for my bishop, and even though normally that is really good, it actually sucks for

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,360
 this challenge.

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,800
 Therefore, knight back to D7.

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,760
 Let's just let him take that pawn and I'll develop my bishop first.

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,400
 He takes D6.

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,760
 I mean I should spend some time to count the squares after bishop takes D6.

62
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,120
 But no, I don't have such luxury.

63
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,600
 Bishop takes D6.

64
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,360
 I have faith that I will not go over 40 squares.

65
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,020
 Ha.

66
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,160
 He even blocked down a square for me.

67
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,880
 That blunders a pawn.

68
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,160
 And even better, my bishop on D6 was seeing a long diagonal to his king, but when it's

69
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,800
 over here, his knight has already blocked out such diagonal.

70
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
 A pawn push.

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
 Another trade.

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,560
 Okay now please just see that your queen can go horizontally.

73
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,640
 Perfect.

74
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,760
 Castle.

75
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,360
 Here's how I predict it will happen.

76
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,120
 Bishop B2, queen F6, and 2 things can happen.

77
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,200
 One is that he takes my queen immediately and I win this game.

78
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,720
 Two is that he moves his queen away and my video is f***ed.

79
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
 Ah ha.

80
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,560
 Here we go.

81
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,920
 Queen F6.

82
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,240
 Man.

83
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,760
 This is obviously a suicidal decision.

84
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
 No.

85
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,960
 Wait.

86
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,640
 There is still a chance that it's not over 40 yet.

87
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,260
 Let's count.

88
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:31,160
 5 pawns is 10, knight is 14, king 15, each rook can move 4 squares, so it's 23.

89
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,760
 And then there's the queen.

90
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
 My goodness.

91
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,640
 25, 27, 31, 34, 39, and 4.

92
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:56,120
 *outro*
