00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 100 rated chess, but you blunder your queen, every time your opponent blunders a piece.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:15,440
 Not pawn. This is going to be short. We get a 1-16 from Argentina. As usual, E4.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:26,560
 C5. Sicilian. Knight F3. E5. Aha, the very famous, ja-la-la bad variation.

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,920
 But anyway. I'll take the free pawn. I remember that I once learned about the ja-la-la bad

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,160
 variation, but it's been a long time since then, so it's actually pretty scary that I may get caught

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:47,680
 in his opening preparation. Nevermind. That blunders a rook to queen H5 check G6 knight

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,520
 takes G6 H takes G6 queen takes H8, and even though I have to blunder my queen according to the rules,

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,240
 I haven't gone for that line yet, so to make things fair, knight back to F3. I didn't play

9
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:09,200
 queen H4, so he didn't blunder his rook, which means I don't have to blunder my queen. Everyone

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:17,680
 is happy. C4. That blunders a pawn, but do I even take it though, because that pawn opens up the way

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,840
 for his bishop to go to A3, which blunders a bishop, which means I'll have to blunder my queen,

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,400
 and since there is no way for me to do so, I'll have to end the video instead.

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:38,160
 Well, no one plays like that anyway. Bishop takes C4. Once again, this is not a thing.

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:47,680
 Thank you. D4. I know that allows bishop C5 ends the video, but I have faith that he's not going

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:56,480
 to play it. Knight G4. I really want to play H3 knight back bishop takes, but somehow I have a

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,840
 feeling that he's just gonna take my F2 pawn and blunder his knight, which forces me to blunder

17
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:12,560
 my queen. So I guess, E5. D takes E5. D takes E5. I'm actually amazed that he hasn't taken my F2

18
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:20,240
 pawn yet, since most 100 rated opponents I've met always play like that. Nevermind. That blunders a

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:27,360
 horsey, and as the rule mentioned, blundering a woman is forced. I mean keeping the queen on D1

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,120
 for him to take is also fine, but I have a feeling that he's just gonna take my rook, which allows me

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:43,840
 to retreat my queen. Well. That's sad. I'll take the knight. Alright, now just calm down, and move

22
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,920
 your bishop away from my pawn, because you know, if he blunders another piece, I'll have to end my

23
00:02:49,920 --> 00:03:00,320
 video, since I have no queen left to sacrifice. Yes. Bishop E3. Alright. Take it. And my king

24
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:14,160
 will join the battle. Or not. Knight C3. H5. Very aggressive. Rook D1. A6. This guy really doesn't

25
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:26,480
 want my king to be in danger. Knight E4. H4. That blunders a pawn. Knight takes C5. B takes C5.

26
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:38,320
 Bishop takes C5. H3. Ah ha! I think I have an idea. Knight D4. I'm calculating, H takes G2,

27
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:46,960
 knight F5, G pawn changes gender, knight takes G7, checkmate. Ha! Perfect plan,

28
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,880
 except if he blunders a piece to end my video before that.

29
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,820
 What the f-

30
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:09,400
 [Outro]
