00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 100 rated chess, but you need to promote all 8 pawns to queens before you can checkmate.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,400
 If someone asks me whether I want to change my gender or not, I will probably say no,

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,160
 but the pawns, they don't have any rights to refuse. We get a 173 from Brazil.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,840
 E4. According to the challenge, I am not allowed to lose any pawns,

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,040
 which means pushing a center pawn is just too risky. Therefore, B6.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,520
 Knight f3, bishop b7, now if he can play d4 and blunder the e-pawn, it would be very convenient.

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,640
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. I'll take this pawn.

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:54,800
 Knight g5. Very aggressive. I'll go back. Knight c3. G6, the plan is very simple,

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,600
 I just need to win all of his pieces, without putting any pawns in danger.

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:10,080
 Knight b5. Man these moves are getting very suspicious. Bishop g7. Bishop f4. Ah ha,

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,440
 he obviously wants to go knight c7 forking my king and rook. Therefore, d6. But man,

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,640
 I cannot tell you how many times I have seen people still capture with their knights in this

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,280
 situation because they did not see the pawn is already blocking the bishop's view.

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:36,400
 Thank god. Oh. Wait. I think I've blundered somewhere. Because now he is targeting the

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,120
 f7 pawn, but if I play knight h6, there is actually bishop takes f7. Knight takes f7,

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,680
 knight e6, queen c8, queen e2, I actually have no way to defend both my bishop and my rook,

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,240
 not to mention that bishop takes f7 at the beginning has already ended the video,

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,360
 or even if I play e6, there is still bishop takes e6 ending the video f takes e6 knight takes e6

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,560
 and the same thing happens as the other line. Is this some sort of theory? I mean this guy is

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,840
 absolutely destroying me right now, and this doesn't even have many relationships towards

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:21,440
 the challenge, he is just purely crushing my opening setup here. e6, e6 should be the better

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,480
 move than knight h6, and if he really sees bishop e6 best move, I will be very gladly end the video,

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,600
 because he is obviously a smurf that is much better than me.

24
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:40,400
 Ha! Nevermind, that was just pure luck in the opening. Taking that pawn is just asking him to

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:52,080
 end my video, therefore, e5 is kinda forced, in no world do you take my pawn here. Queen e2. Wow!

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,160
 A few days ago, I met an opponent that knows how to deflect my king to win my queen,

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,280
 and now I get to meet a guy who can pin my pawn so that he doesn't have to move his bishop.

28
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,680
 Knight f6. Alright, it's all good. I actually don't even want to take that bishop anyway because

29
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,840
 it puts my pawn too far forward, and since he is so good that he can play a move like queen e2,

30
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,560
 there is no way he will take a pawn right now.

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,960
 What the f-

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:41,520
