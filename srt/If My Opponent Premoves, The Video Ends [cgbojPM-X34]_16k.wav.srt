1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 If your opponent pre-moves, the video ends.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 In case you don't know, they pre-move a lot in the 100 rated elo, especially in the opening.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 You may argue that you didn't see anyone did so in my videos, but actually, I adjusted the time between the moves, so that the video would become more natural.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 And with that out of the way. Let's find an opponent.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 We get a 220 from the US.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 First move. There is a chance that my opponent has already pre-moved E5, D5, Nc6, Nf6, E6, or anything possible.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And if that is the case, this video will end right on move 1, and there's nothing I can do about it.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 So anyway. E4.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 After a move is made, the time that is spent for that move, is written right... here.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 For example, right here, it is saying that I spent 1.1 second for my E4 move.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 A pre-move uses 0.1 second to happen, so if you see a 0.1 on the board, it means that my opponent has just made a pre-move, which ends the video.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 E5. That took 4.4 seconds, so it's definitely not a pre-move.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 But now, there are also some chances that he has pre-moved Nc6, Nf6, or even Qh4.

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And once again, there is no way for me to stop any of those.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Therefore, I think that I will play H4, and if he really played Qh4, the video will end, with a big Queen blunder.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Okay here we go.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 H4.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 H5.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Ah ha! I think this guy is a copycat!

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 And do you know the best thing about copycats?

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 They... don't... pre-move!

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Nf3.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Rh6.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Okay, not a copycat then.

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 But still, since he brought out his rook, I don't think he will pre-move anything, since there are always chances that his rook is attacked, which makes a pre-move too easy to become a blunder.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 D4.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 C5.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 That blunders a rook.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 But do I even take it though?

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Because maybe he already see that he blundered his rook, and already pre-moved knight takes H6 over there.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Alright. I guess I won't take the risk.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Bg5.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Rg6.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 That blunders a queen.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But once again, do I even take it though?

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 There is a chance that he has already pre-moved king takes D8, which will be activated, if I take his queen.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Alright. I won't take the risk again.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 D takes E5.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Qa5 check.

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 That's actually good for me.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Because since he brought out his queen, his queen is easier to be attacked, which makes it even less likely that he's going to pre-move.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Nc3.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Qb5.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 That blunders a queen.

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 And since there is no available recapture, I will take it.

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Rb6.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Ah ha! After such a long time with no victory!

49
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Nc7.

50
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Checkmate!

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Challenge, accomplished!

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:57,000
