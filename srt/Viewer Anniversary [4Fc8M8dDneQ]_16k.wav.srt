1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 100 rated chess, but it's my wedding anniversary.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,400
 The king and queen must move together to the other side of the board without being captured.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,920
 It's been a week since this guy made this donation to me, but as they always say, better

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,600
 be late than never.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,520
 A very difficult challenge, but I'll try my best to make this anniversary go really well.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
 E4.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,520
 E5.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:31,400
 I mean I'll try my best, but whether my opponent will cooperate with me or not, that I cannot

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,160
 control.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,880
 And it seems he won't be cooperating.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,120
 I was about to go king E7, but as that is blundering mate in one now.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,840
 Knight C6 instead.

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,480
 Bishop C4.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,920
 G6.

15
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,080
 Nothing wrong so far, nevermind.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,040
 That blunders a woman, but if I take that woman, there is a very big chance that he'll

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,240
 resign, so I guess.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,860
 King E7.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,080
 We are making progress here.

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,880
 Queen H4 check.

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,980
 Aha.

22
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:11,160
 If I move my king, he may decide to make a queen trade, which ends the video.

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,600
 Therefore, knight blocks.

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,960
 I mean if he takes my knight, king takes also ends the video as my king and queen are not

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,980
 together anymore.

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,840
 Who plays like that anyway?

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,080
 Right?

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,360
 No doubt.

29
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,200
 But that blunders a bishop, D5.

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,680
 I mean I don't want to take a woman, but I'm not saying no to a free bishop.

31
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,080
 Nevermind.

32
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,840
 That blunders the woman again, but I'll take the pawn.

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,940
 As long as there is no crazy queen blunder that force my king to leave his wife, nothing

34
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,080
 can go wrong here.

35
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,400
 Dude.

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,720
 I didn't even know this move exists.

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,680
 Well, I have no other choices.

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,000
 I mean since he literally forced me to take his woman, of course he won't be resigning.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Right?

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Ha.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Doubters.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,360
 Pawn takes.

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:23,200
 We win this game for sure.

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,720
 Well even though this video didn't go well, I wish you all the happiness with your partner

45
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,560
 as you continue your life journey together.

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,720
 I'll do better next year.

47
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,220
 And what the fu-

48
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:47,760
 *Outro music*
