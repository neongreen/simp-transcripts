1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
 If your opponent pieces, not pawns, c20 squares or more.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:07,560
 The video ends.

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,740
 Let's go.

4
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,680
 We get a 2 36 from the US.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,920
 Ah, I was hoping that I can get the white pieces, since it should be much better if

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,580
 I can go first.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:21,040
 But well, that is life.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,400
 E3.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,080
 Wow.

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,120
 That was just his first move, and the number is already 11 out of 20.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,280
 And to make things fair, I think we can all agree that we should only count the empty

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,520
 squares.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,960
 With that said, his queen is obviously the most dangerous piece.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,580
 Therefore, knight f6.

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,440
 At least that stopped queen h5 and queen g4.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,880
 Bishop c4.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,040
 Aha!

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,480
 That gives me some free tempos.

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,960
 d5.

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,400
 And the best thing is, even if he plays queen f3 right now, his queen's view is already

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,960
 blocked by my d-pawn.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,600
 Bishop b3.

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,800
 c5.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,800
 Knight c3.

25
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,680
 Let's try to trap his bishop.

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,240
 a6.

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,120
 e4.

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,240
 That blunders a bishop.

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,160
 c4.

30
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,960
 A desperado.

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,320
 d takes c4.

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,520
 d4.

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,020
 Okay that could have ended the video.

34
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:34,880
 So let's count, 1 2 3 4 5, 16 squares.

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,880
 Ha!

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,520
 Not even close.

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,480
 Now the French move is possible, but sadly, there is queen takes d3, which can very well

38
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,280
 just straight up end the video, and since I didn't have time to count the squares during

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,000
 the game, I decided to go.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,240
 d5.

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,800
 And don't worry, I already counted the free squares even if he takes my e-pawn, and it

42
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,960
 was only, 9, 10.

43
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,380
 Which is not even close.

44
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,860
 Knight f3.

45
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,520
 So he doesn't want to trade queens, and actually that's also good for me, since his knight

46
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,440
 closed down his queen's diagonal.

47
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,260
 Therefore, bishop g4.

48
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,600
 Of course I need to pin his knight down, so his queen's diagonal will keep on being closed.

49
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,280
 Castle.

50
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,880
 e takes d4.

51
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,120
 I didn't count the squares in case of queen takes d4, but since most of her roots are

52
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,400
 closed down, it shouldn't be too bad.

53
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,680
 Knight e2.

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,480
 I'll take this knight then.

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,400
 Knight takes d4.

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,760
 Yes!

57
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,080
 That blunders a woman.

58
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,960
 Rook takes d1.

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,880
 And since the queen is pretty much the only piece that I'm scared of, now I'm confident

60
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:00,760
 to say, that this mission, is 100% a victory.

61
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,900
 Rook takes d1.

62
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,920
 Bishop c5.

63
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,480
 Knight c6.

64
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:13,380
 That blunders a king, but of course, we still need to count the controlled squares, to make

65
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,380
 it official.

66
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,120
 1, 2, 3 4 5, 19.

67
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,920
 Not even close.

68
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,300
 And since you're already watching this long into the video, I just want to tell you that

69
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,440
 I have another channel, featuring some very simple games from random people around the

70
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
 internet.

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,960
 Feel free to check it out through the link in the description below.

72
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,000
 Queen takes d1.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Checkmate.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,560
 Mission, accomplished.

75
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:58,500
