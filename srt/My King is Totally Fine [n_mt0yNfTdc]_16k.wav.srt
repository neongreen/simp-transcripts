 100 rated chess, but your pieces can only move one square when they are attacked.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,680
 This obviously sounds too easy, so let's just say, that my opponent's pieces can see through

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:20,640
 everything. Now it's a bit more challenging. We get a 163 from the US. E4. My e-pawn is not being

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,840
 attacked by anything, therefore, E5. Alright, now queen h5 will be very dangerous because she's

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,120
 gonna see a ton of my pieces. But who develops their queen first anyway? Right?

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:42,640
 Knight c6. It's fine, it's not like a lonely queen is gonna destroy my video or anything.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:53,440
 Bishop c4. G6. Queen g5. Aha, that blunders a queen, but since his queen is also attacking my

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,480
 queen, my queen can only move one square due to the rules, so I actually cannot take it. Bishop g7

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,200
 then. Knight f3. I really want to develop this knight, but since his bishop is attacking it,

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:15,680
 the knight can only move one square, which is not possible, so I guess, d6. Knight takes e5.

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,880
 That blunders the woman again, but sadly, I have to take the knight instead. Bishop d5.

12
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,400
 That once again blunders the same woman, and to be honest, since I cannot take it anyway,

13
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,640
 I'd rather kick it away. Alright, now queen takes e5 will be very problematic because since his

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,320
 queen will be attacking my bishop, I cannot move it 2 squares, his bishop is attacking my knight,

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,920
 so my knight also cannot capture, which means I'll have to move my king, but who plays like

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:02:01,200
 that anyway? Right? Right? Ha. Of course, but since the video is still so short, once again,

17
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,360
 I'll answer some of your comments. This is like anti-chess, it's unfun, and you almost never get

18
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,480
 to make any interesting decisions. Well, I'm sorry you're disappointed. Despite check to end the

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,880
 video, simp has more evidence that his opponents aren't paid actors now. Finally. Someone has

20
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,400
 finally stood by my side, if you were a girl, I would have asked you out for a date. Don't tell

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:41,840
 my girlfriend.
