00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 100 rated chess, but if an enemy piece touches your piece, yours can never move again.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:13,840
 Including the pawns sounds absolutely impossible, therefore, I guess we have to say. Not pawns.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,120
 Let's go, we get a 1 27 from Poland. E4, since the pawns are not affected by the rules,

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,560
 they will definitely contribute a major part to my victory today.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,200
 Knight F6, I'll A kind defense. E5, no offense to I'll E kind, but I think this opening sucks.

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:46,640
 Knight D5. C4. Knight F4. Guess what, still theory baby. D4. Knight G6. Ah ha, now I guess

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,400
 knight F3 is the best move, but once again, since my pawns are not affected by the rules,

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:01,040
 I really want to use them to their maximum value. Therefore, F4. F6. Very aggressive,

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:08,720
 that blunders a horsey to F5 knight H4 queen H5 check G6 queen takes H4, but after my queen H5,

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,320
 my queen will actually be touching his knight, so she won't be able to move anymore, which means

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,280
 I'll be blundering my woman. So I guess, I'll go for a bigger target. Queen H5, and I've just

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,120
 realized that my queen is also touching his knight in this position, so she actually also cannot

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:36,560
 move anymore. Man, I have no idea what I'm doing right now. And to be honest, I also have no idea

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,800
 what he's doing right now. F5 wins his knight but after H takes, I actually cannot take his rook

15
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,280
 because my queen cannot move anymore, therefore, bishop D3. This is starting to look like a real

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:59,760
 100 rated game, from both sides. F takes E5. Very aggressive. Bishop G6 also gets the same idea with

17
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:07,600
 F5 last move. Therefore, F5. I'll attack his king, not his other pieces, because my woman is going to

18
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,840
 die very soon. E6. Aha, in this position, there is actually a checkmate in 9 moves for white,

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,040
 so if you're interested, please feel free to pause the video and look for the checkmate pattern,

20
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,440
 while I don't give you any seconds to do so, and the answer is, F takes G6 check. In case you're

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:36,880
 wondering, I did see that entire checkmate in 9 pattern. Trust. H takes G6. Aha, that just took

22
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,280
 the checkmate length from 9 to 5, which is very convenient. The move is bishop takes G6 check.

23
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,920
 It's actually very funny that he can literally go king G8, which blunders bishop F7 checkmate in 1.

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,600
 But since my bishop cannot move anymore after touching his king, his king will actually be safe

25
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:02,240
 on G8. Or he can just make the game really convenient for me by blundering his king in a

26
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:10,720
 different way. Queen G5 is against the rules, therefore, bishop G5 checkmate. That was easy.

27
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:25,680
