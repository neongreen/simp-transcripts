 100 rated chess, but you don't reveal the challenge.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,080
 And somehow this idea got 18 brilliant votes.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,000
 But anyway, we get a 118 from Italy.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,200
 And you know what, if I take on this post normally,

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,360
 the game will be too easy and it also won't make any sense because I always

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,560
 need some sort of challenge in order to make a video.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,040
 Therefore, let's say that I will uncover this very suspicious black section

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,480
 after I've captured my opponent's queen.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,200
 d4. According to the challenge, I can actually play this game like a

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,040
 normal person. Therefore, let's try to win this game

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,440
 real fast with the England gambit. Gambit declined. Well if he doesn't take

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,000
 mine, I'll take his. Now he takes.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,120
 c5. In case you don't know, developing a deep pawn as the first move makes the

14
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,880
 position become very positional and very hard to attack his king,

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,040
 so if he can at least blunder a piece right now, that will make things a lot

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,760
 easier for me.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:14,480
 Well, very convenient. I'll take it. b4. That blunders a pawn.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:23,120
 c3. I'll go back this way. queen a4. Very aggressive. Queen c7.

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,880
 Man since I'm playing this game in an absolutely normal way,

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,960
 there are not many things happening for me to talk about.

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,880
 e4. That blunders a rook. Bishop takes c3 check. Knight takes c3.

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,400
 Queen takes c3 check. King e2. Very aggressive. Queen takes a1.

23
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,520
 Let's just hope that he won't resign the game before I capture his queen.

24
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,640
 Queen b5. Knight c6. Threatening knight d4 forking his king and his queen.

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,800
 Well maybe I don't have to. But now the question is,

26
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,560
 do I take his queen? If I take his queen right now,

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,320
 I will have to uncover the suspicious black part in the challenge,

28
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,640
 and since it got 18 brilliant votes, we can be sure that it is something either

29
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,880
 very nasty, or very stupid.

30
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:27,440
 Well as always, I'm not a coward. Alright, let's see what is going on right here.

31
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,920
 The video ends you f***ing idiots.
