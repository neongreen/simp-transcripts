 100 rated chess, but every 5 moves you have to start a new match. You may stop when you checkmate,

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,360
 or draw, within 5 moves. Just to be clear, even though I added or draw here, it doesn't mean that

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,760
 I will try to draw a game instead of checkmating my opponent. Let's go. And since I think I will

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,800
 be facing many opponents from now on, let's not introduce our opponents for this video.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,560
 E4. Since I only have 5 moves to destroy him, the best plan is obviously. The 4 move checkmate.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:40,640
 Knight F6. I really want to play E5 here, but as we all know, we don't have time for that.

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,280
 Bishop C4. I mean the worst case scenario is that he'll play E6 absolutely block away my bishop and

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,960
 there is no way I can checkmate him anymore, but who refuses a free pawn anyway. Right?

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,520
 D4. Okay the situation is actually pretty hopeless now. But I still have a plan.

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:08,960
 Knight takes E4. Here we go. Bishop G5. The plan is very simple. He blunders his queen,

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,640
 I take his queen on move 5. He resigns. Nevermind. And even though it's only been 4 moves into the

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,960
 game, I don't think there is a way to win this game within the next 4 moves.

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:36,960
 E4. Same plan as before. E5. This time I'll go with queen first. D5. Aha, that totally prevents

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,920
 bishop C4 quick checkmate from happening, so I guess my only choice is. Queen takes E5. There

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,800
 is no way I can checkmate him within the next 2 moves, but if he can just block with his bishop

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:57,520
 right now and then blunder his rook next, maybe he'll be sad enough to resign. I'll take this

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,760
 pawn. And since I have absolutely no idea how to win this game within the next move. Next opponent.

18
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,480
 E4. Man, I feel like a guy who is trying to get a girlfriend by flirting with one girl after

19
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,400
 another. E5. Queen H5. I mean knight F6 is actually really bad because even though I get to win a

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,680
 pawn, his king's safety will be too high that even magnum carlos won't be able to break through within

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:35,600
 5 moves. Queen takes E5. I can already see, that we'll have to play the 4th game. Queen blocks.

22
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,520
 Trading queens is definitely a bad idea. Queen takes C7. I only have 1 move left,

23
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,200
 but if he can just take this pawn with his knight and blunder his bishop,

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,920
 maybe he'll resign after that. Very convenient. Queen takes F8. Queen blocks is forced,

25
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,480
 and now instead of starting a new game, I'll sit here and wait for a resignation.

26
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:19,200
 Well. New game I guess. E4. E5. Starting with black is actually a bit more problematic because

27
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,200
 it is harder to make a quick checkmate, but who knows, maybe I'll get lucky after losing 3 times

28
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,120
 in a row with white. Queen H5. Ah ha, so instead of me scholars mating him, now it's him who is

29
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:41,760
 trying scholars mate me. Queen F6. Ah ha, as soon as I defended my F pawn, he doesn't want to

30
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:50,240
 scholars mate me anymore. Which is to say. Coward. Bishop C5. Queen F2 is not checkmate, but if he

31
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,360
 can play bishop D1 here, that will be the most convenient thing that can ever happen on this

32
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:03,440
 channel. Of course it doesn't happen. Only 2 moves left for checkmate, and since there is obviously

33
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:12,800
 no way to do that, I have an idea. G6. Queen takes E5. And now since he's taken one of my pawns,

34
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:20,960
 offer a draw. Draw accepted. Mission accomplished, and in case you are wondering why did I sacrifice

35
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,240
 a pawn before I offer a draw, you might have noticed that my opponent is actually from India,

36
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,040
 and since Indians are very friendly, the fact that I offer a draw just after blundering a

37
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,320
 pawn makes him thinks that I made that blunder on accident, so he accepted the offer.

38
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:50,960
