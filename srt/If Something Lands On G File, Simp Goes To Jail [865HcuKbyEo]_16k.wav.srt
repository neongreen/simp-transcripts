 If a piece or pawn lands on the G file, Simp goes to jail.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Ah ha. G for ja, ja, ja, jail.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Anyway, we get a 170 from Germany.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 For those of you who are looking for the G file, it is right here.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Of course there are already some pieces and pawns on the file, but I think we can all agree, that the starting position, doesn't, count.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 But anyway. Now there are 2 threats of G6 and G5, but since there is no way to prevent both of them,

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 D4. At least now I can prevent G5 from happening. And about G6. Well, let's just hope that he won't do it.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 D5. Ah ha, he obviously wants to go BG4, which ends my video. Therefore, E4.

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 C6. The Karo-Kan opening. He takes D5.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 Queen takes. Ah ha. Very tricky. Instead of taking my pawn with this pawn, he took it with his queen, so that he can safely play G5 next move.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Which ends the video. Therefore, Knight C3. And in no world do you play G5 here.

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Yes. I want to play Knight F3, but sadly, it will allow Bishop G4, which ends the video. Therefore, H3.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Knight H6. Wow. Not only he doesn't push G6 to end my video, but he also offers a knight and bishop exchange, which then takes his G-pawn away from the G-file, so there is no G6 anymore.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 This video is definitely going to be very long. Bishop takes H6.

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 E6. Wait what? He didn't take my bishop back, which actually keeps his pawn on the G-file.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 But now comes the question. Should I pull my bishop back? I mean if I just leave the bishop there, he may be going to take it next turn, which should be good,

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 but then there will be the threat of Bishop G7, which I think is also very hard to stop. But on the other hand, if I pull my bishop back, the G6 threat will come back, which is also not good for the video.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Alright. Bishop F4. I mean since he already played E6, his bishop can totally be developed in the normal way, and there is no reason to play G6. Right?

19
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 H6. He obviously wants to go G5 to attack my bishop. Bishop H2. Now there is no reason to play G5.

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Well, before I go to jail, let's see.

21
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 ...of any kind is not in any way permitted. There's no way I'm going there then.

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:55,000
