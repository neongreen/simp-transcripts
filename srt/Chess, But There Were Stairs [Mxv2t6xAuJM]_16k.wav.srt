00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 100 rated chess. But I have to take a pawn first, then I can take knights, then I can take bishops,

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,480
 and then rooks, queens, checkmate. Man, these challenges are getting really long these days.

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:29,760
 But anyway, we get a 1 1 3 from Sri Lanka. E4, C6, Karo-Kan, D4. Karo-Kan is really good for

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,760
 this mission, because I can take his D pawn right after he plays D5. Well, unless he doesn't play

5
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:49,040
 D5 and absolutely ruins my plan. E5, knight H5. That blunders a horsey, but sadly, I cannot take

6
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:56,640
 it, due to the rules. D5. Well that knight is trapped anyway, so if I can just take a pawn

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,920
 real fast, there is a chance that he still cannot get his knight to safety. G5. Wow. I can't believe

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,280
 that right after blundering his knight, he then found a way to save his knight, pretty much

9
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:22,640
 immediately. D takes C6. Ha ha, pawn down, next stop, the horses. And that was easier than I

10
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:30,400
 expected. That blunders a horsey. Well, technically he's been blundering that horsey for like 3 moons,

11
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:39,520
 but only now I can really take it. Next on the list, the bishops. Rook G8. That blunders a bunch

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:48,960
 of pawns right here, but who cares anyway. Bishop C4. Knight A6. That blunders a king.

13
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,160
 But do I even take it though? So in the past videos, I decided to checkmate my opponent,

14
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,960
 even though it breaks the rules, but this time, the challenge even mention about the

15
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,000
 checkmate itself, which makes it kinda hard to do the same. Alright, I have decided,

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,440
 that I will respect the rules for this video. Knight C3. Oh wait. Maybe I should have taken

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:25,120
 this pawn. Well who cares anyway. Rook G7. Okay now I'll take that pawn. And in no world do you

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:33,520
 take my bishop now. E6. Just as my bishop was starting pinning down his E pawn to his queen,

19
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:42,080
 he was like. No, you're not pinning anything here. Bishop H6. It's actually fine though,

20
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,680
 since after he moves his rook away, I can finally take his bishop. Or he just moves his bishop away

21
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,200
 and blunder his rook instead. And I cannot take his rook, due to the rules. This game is going

22
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:07,040
 very wrong very quickly. Castle. Rook G8. I'll take this pawn. Bishop take C6 is brilliant.

23
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,880
 Well, since chess.com fixed the brilliant move stuff to be easier to get, those things suck now,

24
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:21,120
 so let's just see if he can see rook G6, blocking the checkmate, and also save the queen.

25
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,960
 Nope, he didn't. And I've just realized, that even though that was a brilliant move,

26
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,760
 it actually caused me to lose a bishop, since I cannot take his queen. Well who cares anyway.

27
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,880
 Knight E4. Knight F6 check will force him to take my knight, which then gives me a bishop,

28
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,080
 and then we can continue the mission. And don't tell me that he'll take my rook with his queen.

29
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,800
 Why is he thinking for so long?

30
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,400
 And he went AFK.

31
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,960
 Mission accomplished.

32
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:19,120
