1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 100 rated chess, but you can only check the opponent's king as many times as they check

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,280
 yours. Ha! In case you don't know, my opponents tend to resign from the game before they get

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:21,040
 checkmated. We get a 100 rated guy from Jordan. D4. E5. Opening up my king for more potential checks.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:28,320
 D takes Edward. And you know what, leaving my king here is probably not a very good idea.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,680
 Therefore, king E7. Come at me you mother******!

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:43,680
 Ha! Plus one baby. F6. The plan is very simple. E takes F6 check, knight takes F6, bishop takes

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,520
 F6 check one more time, and then I'll take with my G pawn. Exactly as planned. Knight takes.

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:00,240
 Bishop H4. Not very aggressive. D5, further opening up the center for even more potential checks.

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:07,760
 G4. That blunders a pawn, and of course winning a lot of materials to make him resign is also

10
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:16,560
 an option. Bishop G3. That bishop has been moving around a lot. King back, I'm just trying to open

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,360
 up the way for my bishop to go out, and I'm definitely not a coward. Queen C1. I have no

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:34,640
 idea what that move does. Bishop C5. H3. Very aggressive. Bishop H5. Bishop E5. I don't want

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:43,360
 to lose that knight. Knight E4. Bishop H2. Ah ha, that allows bishop takes F2 check which forces

14
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,720
 his king to move, but spending a check right now is probably not a very good idea since his king is

15
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:57,120
 still very safe in the center. So I guess, knight takes F2. Knight F3. I was planning to go queen

16
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:05,600
 H4, but I guess now I have to take this rook instead. Queen F4. Very aggressive. I'll take

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,040
 this knight. Losing this bishop is very sad because I think it will do great in checkmating my

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,720
 opponent's king, but who knows, maybe he'll decide not to take my bishop and instead go for something

19
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,480
 like queen E4 which gives me a check and a chance to retreat my bishop at the same time. Right?

20
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:32,160
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor, or unpaid actor. Bishop takes E4.

21
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:40,400
 Bishop G2. That blunders a bishop, but queen H4 check first. That uses a check from my inventory,

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,600
 so now the question is, where's my checkmate in 2?

23
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:52,160
 I see nothing. Queen G5 check is probably the best move aiming for king E1 queen C1 or king

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,240
 C3 queen E3, but if something else happens, I'm not sure if I can ever checkmate him in this game

25
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:07,120
 anymore. So I guess, I'll play it safe. No need to rush, he can resign at any moment now. Knight C3.

26
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,480
 D4. I don't know, just trying to bring more materials into the attack.

27
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:20,400
 Rook G1. Dude, his king is being attack in the middle of the board, yet he decided to fork my

28
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,720
 pieces in the absolute corner. I'll give this check. That also wins me a piece, and based on

29
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,840
 how he's been playing, I bet he'll take with his king or move his king up, which should be really

30
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:40,800
 good for a potential checkmate in 1. Absolutely. Queen B4 queen D4 is checkmate in 2, but since I

31
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:50,720
 only have 1 check left, knight F2 first. Rook takes G2. That blunders a king. Queen B4. Checkmate.

32
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,840
 Mission. Accomplished.

33
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:08,400
