 100 rated chess, but your king is a commander, you can only move something, if your king can see it.

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:22,000
 E4. According to the rules, these are all the things I can move now, and since the woman and

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,880
 bishop are stuck. It all came down to the pawns. E5. I mean F5 is just blundering a pawn, and D5

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,040
 Scandinavian is not good, because if I recapture with my queen, knight C3 will win the woman,

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:45,200
 because I cannot retreat her. Bishop E2. I want to show him that bishop can go further, but sadly,

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:54,240
 that will make me unable to move it again. Therefore, bishop E7. Knight F3. Ah ha, that

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:04,240
 attacks my E pawn, and since knight C6 is against the rule, D6. Castle. Well, I also want to develop

9
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:12,080
 my knight and castle, but sadly, my king doesn't see my knight. So I guess, king F8. I mean now if

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:20,880
 he plays an aggressive move like D4, I will probably resign. And it happened. No. That was

11
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,560
 just a joke, there's no need to resign right now. Knight H6. The reason why D4 was so scary,

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,400
 is because I cannot take it due to the rules, and after he takes my pawn, I still cannot take it due

13
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,640
 to the rules, and after he takes again, my bishop can take, but then comes E5 winning my bishop,

14
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:49,360
 because I once again, cannot move my bishop due to the rules. And it really happened. Wow. This has

15
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,160
 to be the most annoying mission I've ever had on this channel. F6. I mean if he takes this pawn

16
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:06,000
 instead, the situation may get a little bit better. Yeah, or not take anything at all. King F7. Well I

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,880
 mean if he doesn't want to take, I'll take it next turn. Queen D5 check. Very aggressive. That gives

18
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,840
 me a free tempo, but sadly, I have to go back. But that's still fine though, because now he has more

19
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:31,600
 reasons to take this way instead of the other way. Ha! There we go. Bishop takes. Bishop C4.

20
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,800
 Ah ha! He's obviously threatening bishop takes H6, removing the defender of the checkmate in 1.

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,480
 Therefore, G5. I mean that's pretty much the only thing I can move right now, beside the fat king.

22
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:56,480
 Bishop takes. I can already see, that I'm about to be checkmated, very soon. My king can see nothing,

23
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:05,680
 besides himself. Bishop takes D6 check. Alright. Now what? I cannot take with my queen, because

24
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:12,640
 that's against the rules. King takes is not against the rules, but it blunders checkmate in 1. King G6

25
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,760
 also blunders the same checkmate, and king F8. Well, it doesn't blunder checkmate, but with my

26
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:30,400
 queen already dead, I can see that my king also won't be able to live long. Well, I mean queen

27
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:40,880
 G5 looks pretty advanced, so it's not like he can see it right away. Right? Yeah this is obviously

28
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:50,780
 impossible.
