00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 100 rated chess, but you must checkmate with king.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,440
 Sounds very easy, but before the video begins, have you ever been in a situation that you

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,440
 are about to checkmate your opponent and then they said, "Resign right now or I'll expose

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,160
 your IP address to everyone on the internet."

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,280
 Well, with NordVPN, you don't have to worry about those guys.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
 Anymore.

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,840
 Is your computer full of malware because you didn't know anything about computer so you

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,240
 accidentally downloaded them and then don't know how to get rid of them?

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,840
 Well, then I would suggest you clean your SSD first, and then go for, NordVPN.

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,160
 Are you tired of seeing unnecessary too many ads on every single website that you visit?

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,880
 NordVPN can remove those ads for you.

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,080
 Are you living in a country that bans YouTube but somehow still able to find my videos?

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,280

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,720
 Back to the video, we get a 2 1 4 from the US.

19
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
 E4.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
 E5.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,280
 The challenge requires my opponent to not randomly resign during the game, therefore,

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,360
 D4.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,780
 Letting him have some advantages is definitely the best way to start this video.

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,780
 Or not.

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,620
 I'll take this pawn then.

26
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,520
 I mean taking the lead in materials is pretty risky, but since he can immediately take it

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,040
 back, there's nothing to be worried about.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,200
 Right?

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
 Of course.

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
 Knight F3.

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,720
 I'm sorry Edward, but you need to die to reduce the chance of my opponent just randomly

32
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,720
 resigns.

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,680
 Edward is dead.

34
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,960
 Bishop blocks, in no world do you take my bishop and force me to take your queen and

35
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,040
 then resign from the game.

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,480
 Of course.

37
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,400
 Bishop blocks.

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,960
 Bishop C5.

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,800
 Not very aggressive.

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
 Knight C3.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,880
 I mean I actually don't dare to take his queen because that may cause him to rage quit, but

42
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:25,360
 of course, it is totally fine to just give an attack.

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,920
 Queen G4.

44
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,920
 Very aggressive.

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
 Castle.

46
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,560
 Please do not take this pawn.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,600
 I'm worrying too much.

48
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,640
 Knight D5.

49
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,080
 Queen takes B2.

50
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,840
 Ah ha, that blunders a fork, but the best move should be.

51
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,360
 Bishop C3.

52
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,080
 Forking the queen and the rook all the way over the other side of the board.

53
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,160
 Queen A3.

54
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,800
 I'll take this pawn first, okay so even though technically I'm winning this rook next move,

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,600
 since I've just taken a single pawn, there is no reason for him to resign the game right

56
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,160
 now.

57
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,240
 Right?

58
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,480
 Of course.

59
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,800
 Taking this rook is obviously too risky, taking this fork is also too risky.

60
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
 So I guess.

61
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,280
 Bishop C4.

62
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,040
 Theoretically speaking, I only need 2 rooks to checkmate with a king, so the best plan

63
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,680
 is just to try to trade down all the other pieces first, and then get the rooks into

64
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
 action.

65
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,060
 Queen A4.

66
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,080
 Bishop B3.

67
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
 Queen G4.

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,640
 Ah ha, I originally didn't want to take his rook to keep the video alive, but since he

69
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,220
 decided to attack my bishop even though it hasn't done anything wrong, I have to show

70
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,240
 him who's the boss here.

71
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,600
 It should be fine, the 100 rated people don't tend to use their rooks very often anyway,

72
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,440
 so they should have no concern about losing any of them.

73
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,320
 F6.

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:04:00,080
 That blunders a pawn, I mean he should be able to see, that knight takes F6 is blundering.

75
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,040
 It is blundering a queen to knight takes F6 royal fork, but of course I'm not gonna do

76
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,840
 that, and then take this pawn instead.

77
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,160
 King D8.

78
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,240
 That blunders a full piece to knight E6 check forking the bishop, but of course, I'll take

79
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,840
 his rook instead.

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,800
 He should be able to see, that not only did I let his woman live, but I also didn't take

81
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,400
 a full bishop, he should be feeling good about his luck and not resign from this game.

82
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
 Right?

83
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,680
 What the fu-

84
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:49,280
 *outro*
