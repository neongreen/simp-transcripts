 100 rated chess, but the only piece, or pawn, you can take is the piece, or pawn, your opponent

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:19,240
 had just moved. This is going to be annoying. E4, E5, nothing wrong so far. Knight C3, D5,

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:27,920
 let's be really aggressive. D3, not very aggressive. D4, I mean if he can just play knight D5 and

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:37,320
 blunder his knight. It would be very convenient. Of course it doesn't happen. Bishop G4, F3,

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:49,680
 bishop H5, knight G3, aha, I think I have an idea. Knight F6, knight takes H5, aha,

6
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,160
 since he's just moved his knight, I can take it. The plan is very simple. He makes a random

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:04,520
 move, queen H4 check, G3, knight takes G3, and I'll have a big attack on his king. Exactly

8
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:14,080
 as planned. Here we go. Queen H4 check, let's just hope that he won't move his king. Perfect.

9
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,960
 Knight takes G3, well I mean even if he goes H takes G3 now, I actually cannot take his

10
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:27,020
 rook because I can only take the pawn due to the rules. Well, nevermind, that blunders

11
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:33,640
 a king to knight takes E4 discovered check king E2 queen F2 checkmate in 2. But sadly,

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:40,120
 I actually cannot take his Edward due to the rules. Therefore, knight F5 check, I mean

13
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:47,780
 it's still a check, so it shouldn't be too bad. King D2, knight E3, I was kinda scared

14
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:55,200
 of king E2 and bishop E3 to take my knight, but king D2 absolutely made my job a lot easier.

15
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:03,680
 Queen E2. Aha. I think I do have another idea. Knight C6, the plan is knight B4, C takes

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:12,240
 B4, bishop takes B4, checkmate. Nevermind. I mean now there is also bishop B4 check king

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,760
 takes E3 is forced E takes D4 checkmate with a pawn, but sadly, E takes D4 is actually

18
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,440
 against the rules because I cannot take a pawn after he's just moved his king. Therefore,

19
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,600
 I'll take it right now. Alright, it's fine, now there is still bishop B4 checkmate in

20
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:36,160
 one threat, and even if A3 happens, there is also knight B4 oh no my horse E A takes

21
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:45,720
 B4 and bishop takes B4 checkmate. Knight H3. Very aggressive. Bishop B4. Checkmate.

22
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,000
 Mission, accomplished.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,420
