00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge after your 5th move. I'm pretty concerned that

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,960
 there is only one type of reaction, and it is even more concerning that the reaction is a laughing one,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:22,480
 Keck W. But let's go anyway. We get a 127 from Egypt. Knight F3. This knight totally

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,520
 prevented any attempts to scholar checkmate, I guess I'll go for a gun bit. Didn't happen.

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:38,240
 Not yet, knight F6. Stafford gambit, also didn't happen. A counter gambit,

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:45,840
 and since I'm not a coward like him. I'll take. Knight takes. I can take this pawn,

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,320
 but as I'll have to uncover the challenge after 2 moves, it would be better if I can

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:59,680
 make more development beforehand. Bishop C5. Knight E2. Ah ha. Even though I said I should

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,600
 be focusing on development, I'll take. Bishop takes F2 is checkmate in 1, and if we're lucky enough,

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,800
 the challenge should not interfere with this plan. You really need to use the restroom,

11
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:22,240
 you have 5 more moves, before you wet your pants. For your information, I never really have to go to

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,320
 the toilet, because I actually built a pipe system that connects my desk with my house's toilet.

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,120
 So I can literally just poop right here and then the shit will find their own way to the toilet.

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,480
 But you know, a challenge is a challenge, and I guess we only need 1 more move.

15
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,400
 Nevermind. This check is best, but that cannot win the king, queen H4 instead.

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:53,120
 Queen takes E5. He probably thinks that I will take and blunder my woman.

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,680
 But no. A resignation should be coming. Right?

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,280
 Queen B4 check. No more time for development,

19
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,640
 I'll have to find a way to checkmate in 2 with 2 pieces.

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,960
 King D1. Queen B2 is best, but that won't create a checkmate, and since he didn't resign after the

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,800
 woman loss, I don't think he'll resign because of the rook. Knight E4 instead.

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:32,240
 Knight D2. Alright. Here we go. Queen takes D2. Backward bishop moves are very difficult to see,

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,640
 now he's gonna think that he is actually checkmated and the game is bugged out.

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
 Game is bugged and turn off is fun.

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:54,160
