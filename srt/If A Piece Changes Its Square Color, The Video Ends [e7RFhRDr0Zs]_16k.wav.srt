 If a piece or a pawn changes its square color, the video ends.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Wait. No. Let's change this to "Not Pawn".

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Because if pawns count 2, that means it cannot move forward unless it is its first move of 2 squares.

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Playing 3-minute splits on a 100-rated account.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Let's be real. This is not doable.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 At the moment my opponent moves his knight.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 The video ends.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 But anyway, let's find an opponent.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 We get a 135 from India.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Let's just hope he doesn't move his knights right from move 1.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 E4.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Thank you.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 So in order to prevent a knight move, I think I need to keep him busy.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Therefore,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 d5.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
 He takes d5.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Yes.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Normally, people would take back this pawn, going into the Scandinavian defense.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 But of course, since that square is a light square, and my queen is on a dark square,

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 doing that is just ending my own video.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 So I guess, c6.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 That pawn changed its square color.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 But once again, pawns don't count towards the challenge.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 D takes c6.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Yes yes yes.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 The more you move your pawn, the longer this video can be.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 E5.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Please continue to take.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Yes.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Normally, people would suggest me to take back the pawn now, but let's think about this for a moment.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 If I take the pawn back, there's a big chance he'll go bishop b5 check.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 And at that point, I don't have any moves to defend it, because even if bishop c6, bishop takes c6,

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 then I'll either have to move my knight, move my queen, or move my king,

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 and all of those moves are changing the square color of a piece, which makes me a fool, for ending my own video.

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 But don't worry.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 Even if I don't take down that pawn, I think I still have a pretty good plan.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Bishop c5.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Now please take my rook and make a queen.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 And in no world should you take the bishop here.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Why is he still thinking?

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Finally!

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Queen to d4.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Here's my plan.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Now he should be able to see that I'm threatening mate in 1, so he will play queen a to f3 to defend it,

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 then I'll play bishop g4, queen takes g4, and queen takes f2.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Checkmate.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Well he can also just blunder the checkmate right now.

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 That is actually even better to be honest.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 What the f
