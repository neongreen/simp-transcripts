1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 100 rated chess, but it's Friday, all your pieces and pawns already drunk, so all of

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,120
 their moves are random between blunders and best moves.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,600
 Alright, it is time to do some coding.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,600
 Very simple.

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,000
 Our move is going to be randomized between a blunder or a good move, then we tell the

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,160
 computer to show us the result, and since the computer doesn't know what random is,

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,920
 I'll introduce the random guy to it.

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,360
 Alright, that is all good, now I just need to add in a few more things to make it easier

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,680
 for you guys to keep track of the results, you don't need to understand any of these

10
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,160
 things, just watch the video normally, and only care about the results to come.

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,080
 We get a 2 35 from Israel.

12
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,920
 E4.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,640
 First move, let's run the program.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,900
 Move 1 is a blunder, and since there is only one way we can make a blunder, B5 is forced.

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,000
 That's fine, next move is gonna be a good move.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,520
 Queen F3.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,640
 Random, blunder again.

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,960
 Now I have to choose between F5 and D5, and since F5 looks a bit too dangerous, I'll say

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,320
 goodbye to David.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,720
 David is dead.

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,680
 Alright, there is no way this is another blunder.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,440
 Are you serious?

23
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,120
 I'm out of pawns to sacrifice, and C6 is too dangerous because of C7 discovered attack

24
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,020
 on my rook and a 4 coming with promotion.

25
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,720
 So I guess, knight C6.

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
 This video is going very wrong very quickly.

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,120
 D takes C6.

28
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:48,880
 Okay, 3 blunders in a row, statistically speaking, this has to be a good move.

29
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,440
 What the f*** is happening here?

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,040
 Bishop D7 is kinda forced.

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:02,120
 Dude, after he takes, even if I roll a good move, I still have to move the king out.

32
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,360
 Thank you.

33
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,320
 There is no way it happens 5 times in a row.

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,960
 Ah ha.

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,080
 Finally.

36
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,480
 Bishop E6.

37
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,280
 I mean I basically don't have any moves that can magically change the situation after being

38
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,280
 forced to make so many blunders, but if we can get a few good moves in a row, we can

39
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,600
 definitely turn the table.

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,520
 Knight C3.

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,320
 Statistically speaking, I should be getting another good move here.

42
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,120
 Nope, we're back to hell.

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,000
 Bishop back to D7.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,080
 Well I mean it blunders C D7 queen D7 queen A A checkmate in 2, but since he didn't take

45
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,480
 my bishop last time, chances are he also won't take it this time.

46
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,000
 Right?

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,640
 Perfect.

48
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,160
 Ah ha, good move again, bishop E6.

49
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,640
 Bishop F4.

50
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,960
 Blunder.

51
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,100
 What kind of 50/50 is this?

52
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,400
 Bishop F5.

53
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,920
 I'm blundering a pawn through bishop takes C7 queen takes C7 queen takes F5, and of course,

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,040
 blundering through tactics is also a type of blunder.

55
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,120
 He missed it.

56
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,680
 And blunder again.

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,680
 G5.

58
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,960
 It's fine, just a pawn anyway.

59
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,600
 Bishop takes G5.

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,960
 Okay.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:35,800
 Now I need a good move to retreat my bishop, and since we got too many blunders already.

62
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
 Nevermind.

63
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,740
 Bishop G7.

64
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,440
 Queen takes F5.

65
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,440
 Good move.

66
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,720
 Rook B8.

67
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,160
 Queen D7.

68
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
 Randomize.

69
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
 Blunder.

70
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:56,280
 Ha, guess what, the only 2 moves I can make are just equally bad, but since we rolled

71
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,720
 a blunder, I guess it has to be king F8.

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,120
 Bishop takes E7 check.

73
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,440
 Blunder again, but in this situation, the moves are just the same.

74
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,800
 He won.

75
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:19,380
 Okay, the situation is already very bad for me, so I desperately need a good move.

76
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,560
 This has to be the worst program I have ever built.

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,640
 F5, and then in this position, I realized, that F5 doesn't blunder anything.

78
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:43,400
