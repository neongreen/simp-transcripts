00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
 100 rated chess, but your opponent has to have a missed win, before you can win.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,400
 How would simp know if it's a missed win?

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,440
 Ah ha, thank you dude, that is exactly the question I wanted to ask.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,440
 He could intentionally blunder something like mate in 3, and hope that his opponent doesn't see it.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,840
 You know what? That actually sounds like a great idea.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,920
 Let's go, we get a 1 2 3 from the US.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,680
 F4. The bird's opening.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,880
 E5. So in order to blunder checkmate in 3 or something,

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,640
 I believe the best approach to this game, is the bonk loud.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,320
 G3. Wait a second.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,720
 He takes F4. In no world do you take it back.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,560
 Nevermind. That blunder's a king. But the video is still so short.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,240
 Alright, I'm not breaking the rule this game, for the video's length.

14
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,920
 Ke7. Ha, very funny.

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
 Ke7, is a missed, win.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,320
 It was supposed to be my opponent who makes a missed win, and definitely not me, f*** you Stockfish.

17
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,000
 D4. D5.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 By the way, please don't judge my gameplay based on the analysis, because for most of the time,

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,040
 the best move has to be king back to E8, which is definitely not part of the plan.

20
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
 E4. I'll take it.

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,160
 Bb5. Very aggressive.

22
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,960
 Knight F6. Apart from blundering the king on move 3,

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,240
 I think that this guy is actually playing pretty decent.

24
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:52,240
 Maybe not. That blunder's a horsey, but if I take it, I will be at +4, which is too much,

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,080
 and may cause him to resign.

26
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,640
 Therefore, Qd5. My plan is giving him a chance to play Nc3,

27
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,000
 which defends the bishop and also attacks my queen, but since I moved my queen out,

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,160
 it may provoke him to move his queen instead of Nc3, which may be considered, as a missed win.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,280
 Ha. So he did move his queen, but it's a bigger blunder instead.

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,560
 Is this guy a sandbagger?

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,920
 Alright. I'm gonna assume, that this guy is a sandbagger.

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:36,800
 And play. Qxd4. If he's really sandbagging, he will not take my queen, which should obviously,

33
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
 be a missed win. And he took it.

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,040
 F***. He made the correct move at the correct time, while blundering everything else.

35
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,160
 At every other time.

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:57,520
 Bxh3. Okay, it's fine, it's just a woman, I don't need any women to win this game.

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:05,440
 And he blundered his queen back. But if I take it, it will be hard for me to blunder checkmate,

38
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,320
 not to mention that he can also decide to resign.

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,920
 Alright. I have an idea.

40
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,240
 Kd6. Now Qe5 is checkmate in 1, but since I think that he was targeting my b7 pawn,

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,080
 he very much will decide to take it now, which misses the checkmate, which can be a missed win.

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,440
 And he abandoned the game.

43
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,680
 But he hasn't made any missed wins yet.

44
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,040
 What the f***?

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:50,720
