 100 rated chess, but you are a coward, which I am not. You cannot attack pieces with higher value.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,320
 If a higher value piece attacks your pieces, or pawns, they cannot move. Sounds very challenging,

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,080
 but of course, definitely doable. E4. By the way, only for this video, let's just say,

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:30,160
 that king, is 3.5. E5. So normally I would be playing D4 here to open up the position,

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,800
 but since his queen is attacking my D pawn here, bishop C4 instead. For the challenging purpose,

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,960
 let's assume that his pieces can attack through all of the pieces. Knight F6 knight C3 knight C6

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,520
 knight F3 D5 aha. I want to take with my pawn, but since my pawn is being attacked by his knight,

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,360
 which means it cannot move, so I guess, I'll take with horsey. Bishop E6. Taking this knight is

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,560
 amazing, but since my knight is being attacked by his queen, it also cannot move. Castle. Bishop D5

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:14,160
 bishop D5 knight D5 E D5 queen D5. Aha. Now the challenge truly begins. Rook E1. I guess this

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,920
 pawn can never be moved in this entire game. Knight E4. Aha. That blunders a queen to rook

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,560
 takes E5 royal 4 queen takes E5 knight takes E5, but do I even take it though? Because if he doesn't

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,680
 take my rook, I actually can not take his queen according to the rules because the woman would

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:42,080
 be attacking my rook. Well, as always, I'm not a coward. I mean my rook is literally right next

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:50,320
 to his queen. Nevermind. Now it's me who has to defend my rook. In no world do you take this

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,920
 pawn and say that you're forking me here. F6. That still blunders the queen, but I don't even want to

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:07,280
 talk about it. C4. Well at least if he takes this pawn, I can move my rook away. Or not. B3. I don't

18
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,400
 know, just a random move, I don't know what to do anymore. And somehow that random move worked.

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,040
 I still cannot take his queen because my pawn is also being attacked. Rook back to E3. Knight takes

20
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:32,720
 B3. I can take that. Queen A6. Aha. Finally. David can move. King D8. Not very aggressive.

21
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,640
 Bishop G5. Let's sacrifice this bishop to create a chance at a quick checkmate. FG5 knight G5

22
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:50,000
 bishop E7 knight E6 king D7 D5 queen A5 aha. After all this time, that blunders a queen. Ha,

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,960
 I guess we can already predict the result of this video. B6 queen B5 king D6 rook E3 queen C6.

24
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,120
 Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

25
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:15,920
