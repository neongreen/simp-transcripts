00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 100 rated chess, but you are kamikaze. If a piece or pawn captures, it has to capture every move

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,600
 until it dies. Ah ha, it's been a long time since I last get to pick such an easy challenge like

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,960
 this one. We get a 240 from India. E4. So normally I would have prepared a good plan to tackle on the

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,960
 chosen challenge, but since this challenge is obviously way too easy, there is absolutely no

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:36,560
 need to prepare... anything. D5. Ah ha. I'll take that pawn. From now on, Edward can only move

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:47,280
 with a capture. C6. And that is a capture. Ha, can't be any more convenient. B takes C6. D4.

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,760
 G5. Ah ha. That blunders a pawn, but do I even take it though, because if I take it, my bishop

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,120
 won't be able to move anymore, unless there is something for it to capture, which means a move

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:09,520
 like H6 will be forcing me to make a desperado. Well as always, I'm not a coward. I mean at least

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,920
 he cannot play F6 because of queen H5 check. Nevermind. I'll have to sacrifice my bishop,

11
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:26,560
 but before that, queen H5 check. King D7 is forced. Ah ha. As you can see, this pawn is

12
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,080
 actually controlling this very crucial center square, so if I take his pawn, he may decide to

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,120
 replace it with another pawn, which still controls that important E5 square, so I guess, knight F3.

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:47,280
 I want him to take my bishop, and then I can move my knight to E5. F takes G5. Knight E5 check.

15
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,440
 King C7 is bringing his king to safety, but for some unknown reasons, I feel like this

16
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:02,320
 giga chad is gonna advance his king forward. As expected. Bishop C4 check. I think king D6

17
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,800
 blundering a triple fork or blocking with the queen should be the best move here, but since

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,480
 those moves are not very human-like moves, he should be going king F5 blundering queen F3

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:21,360
 checkmate in 1 or king F6 blundering queen F7 checkmate in 1. Right? I solemnly swear,

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:37,920
 that this guy is not a paid actor. But anyway, queen F7 checkmate. Mission accomplished.
