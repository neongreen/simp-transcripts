00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge right before you checkmate your opponent.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,160
 I'm a little worried that there is a WTF reaction right here, but I'm better than my viewers.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:21,280
 We get a 181 from Australia. E4. E5. I can play freely before the challenge begins,

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:28,560
 bishop c4. This is a very niche opening called, the center game accepted, von der Lase gambit,

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:41,280
 which is actually my favorite opening as white. Knight c6. c3. d takes c3. Queen f3. c takes b2.

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,840
 Ah ha, the king blunder happens much quicker than I thought,

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
 but instead of checkmating, of course, it is time to reveal the challenge.

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,560
 Return all your remaining pieces, not pawns, to their starting position,

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,760
 then checkmate your opponent with a pawn. If you have no pawns left, you lose.

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:12,640
 Wow. So now I don't checkmate, I get undeveloped, and my opponent gets a queen.

11
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,680
 This is going very wrong very quickly.

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:31,200
 B pawn changes gender. Bishop f1. Queen takes b1. Alright, now we officially start the game again,

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,280
 with me down 19 points in materials. Knight f3. Let's make it 20.

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,840
 Well, it seems like one queen attacking a small and lonely pawn is not enough. Bishop e2.

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:56,960
 Minus 20. Bishop e3. Queen 4 e6. Castle. My king is officially safe, now we turn the table.

16
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:05,680
 Queen takes a2. Rook e1. It seems like having 2 queens in the early game makes him become

17
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,400
 too confident in himself that he doesn't even care about developing the other pieces,

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,440
 so now we obviously should take over the center of the board, and a blunder should be happening.

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:28,960
 Right. Now. There we go. That blunders a horsey. Queen takes e5. That blunders a queen. Bishop d4.

20
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:39,440
 Queen e d5. Bishop c4 discovered check with a triple attack. Queen e6. That blunders 2 queens.

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:51,280
 Bishop takes a2, and I'll pre-move queen takes e1. Didn't happen. Bishop takes e6. F takes e6.

22
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,560
 I won both his queen, but the material difference is still 6 points in his favor,

23
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,440
 so I still need to be aggressive in order to win something more. Queen h5 check.

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,280
 G6. I think the best move right now should be queen h3 waiting for rook g8 queen h7,

25
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,480
 but I know for sure that he's just gonna blunder his rook, so I guess, queen f3. Disclaimer,

26
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:25,120
 no disrespect here. Knight c6. That blunders a rook. Alright, now I need to start thinking

27
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:32,720
 of a way to checkmate with a pawn, when I only have 3 of them left. Knight e5. Cleaning his

28
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:41,360
 board is also an option. D6. All the way back. I need to find a way to let my queen infiltrate

29
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:51,120
 his territory. Well, very convenient. Queen takes b7. And then after a few more moves,

30
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:59,760
 rook g6 rook d6 queen d6 king f7 rook g4, my opponent resigned. And even though I won the game,

31
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,960
 I couldn't checkmate him with my pawn. Mission not accomplished.

32
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,160
 So,

33
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,780
