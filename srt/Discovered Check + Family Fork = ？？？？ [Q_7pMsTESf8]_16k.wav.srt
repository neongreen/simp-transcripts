00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 100 rated chess, and you live in an absolute theocracy.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,760
 Your bishops live, enemy bishops die.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,640
 Disclaimer, this video means no harm to any living being in this world, everyone deserves

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,360
 to live and this is only for entertainment purposes.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:22,000
 Maybe that was a bit too careful from me for making that disclaim, but you know what they

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 say, better be safe than pregnant.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,640
 We get a 1 1 8 from Italy.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,680
 E4. This challenge is too easy, I dare to say this will be the most obvious victory

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,760
 in this entire channel.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,240
 D5. I'll take.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:43,240
 It's not a very good idea to let his queen move around freely as there is a very big

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,560
 chance he's just gonna blunder her and immediately resign after that.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,760
 But of course.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,400
 No disrespect.

15
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,920
 Queen takes.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,360
 Knight c3.

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,520
 Queen e5 check.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,520
 Bishop blocks.

19
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,200
 I mean if he takes my bishop, the video ends.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,680
 But who plays like that anyway?

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,960
 Right?

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
 No doubt.

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
 D4.

24
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,540
 I mean you cannot take my bishop, but of course you can take this pawn.

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,080
 Of course it doesn't happen.

26
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,480
 Knight f3.

27
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,960
 Knight f6.

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,240
 It's very annoying that he is blocking his own bishops from going out, which increases

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,520
 the difficulty of the challenge.

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,900
 So I guess.

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,120
 Knight b5.

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,600
 Queen b4 check.

33
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,000
 Ah ha.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,160
 Now best move is bishop d2, but then he'll be forced to go queen e7, which actually even

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,920
 further blocks his dark square bishop.

36
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,880
 Therefore, c3 instead.

37
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,560
 And then queen e7 regardless.

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,080
 Bishop f4.

39
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,240
 This game.

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,020
 Will take a while.

41
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,660
 Knight e4.

42
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,320
 Very aggressive.

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,200
 That blunders a fork.

44
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
 King d7.

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
 Dude.

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,480
 I suddenly have a very nasty idea.

47
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,600
 Knight e5 check.

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,240
 King takes c7.

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,320
 Ha!

50
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,360
 That blunders a woman.

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,200
 Knight g6.

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,280
 Discovered check with a fork on his queen and his rook, which I guess you can call, a triple

53
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
 attack.

54
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,720
 E5.

55
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,760
 I've just realized that even though that tactic looks fancy, it actually brought the video

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,380
 to a very bad situation.

57
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:41,340
 If I take this queen, there is a 50% chance the video ends, but if I take this pawn, he

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,900
 can also sack his queen into my bishop, and we're not going to talk about knight takes

59
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,540
 e5 because it makes me look like an a** for choosing this tactic.

60
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,640
 I've made up my mind.

61
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,480
 Bishop takes e5.

62
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:07,240
 A lot of squares to move his king to, so the statistics are actually favoring me.

63
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:26,000
 Well I actually saw that was coming, so there is no what the f*** today.
