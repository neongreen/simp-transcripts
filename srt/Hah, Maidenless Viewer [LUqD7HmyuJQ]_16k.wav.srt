1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 I'm better than my viewers, harem vs maidenless. And guess what, I get to take the harem side.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,560
 Ladies and gentlemen and gays, welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers,

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,360
 the series that I made to prove that I don't need any paid actors to make my videos,

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,560
 and the viewer this time is a guy called, Trinke.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,120
 Eh what? E3 is forking my queens, so of course, I have to take that pawn first.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,840
 G3. Aha, that creates a double attack, so I guess I have to take this bishop.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,360
 G takes F2. Queen takes, stockfish didn't really like that move, but I have no idea why.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,440
 Knight G8. Undeveloping a piece just to start an attack on my queen,

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,880
 which can be considered, as very aggressive. But that blunders a rook. Rook takes. Queen F3.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,040
 Knight B8. Man, it seems like this guy doesn't like horses very much. I'll take this pawn,

11
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,240
 I mean this knight is kinda useless anyway, so why not using it to open up the board,

12
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,880
 and who knows, maybe he won't even take it.

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,640
 Knight B5. I'm threatening knight takes C7 smothered checkmate in one,

14
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,720
 so if he can also blunder that right now, that will be very convenient.

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,000
 Ha, of course he's not a paid actor. Queen takes. Knight E6. Knight E2.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Rook A5. That allows an infiltration. Once again, I'm threatening queen C8 knight E8 knight C7

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,600
 checkmate in two, and since he's definitely not a paid actor, there is no way he's blundering

18
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:58,160
 such an obvious checkmate. Right? Of course. Queen D5. Centralizing a queen. E4. That blunders a pawn.

19
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:06,320
 F5. Ah ha. That is very tricky. First he blunders his E pawn to make me turn off my guard,

20
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,200
 and then he pretends to blunder his F pawn to provoke me to take it which allows rook H1

21
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,240
 knight G1 rook A1 and I have no way to defend my bishop. So I guess, I'll take this pawn instead.

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:23,360
 This way, my queen can still defend my bishop if he still decides to follow that continuation.

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:32,480
 Rook H1. Just as I predicted. Knight G1. Rook A4. So instead of rook A1,

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,640
 he decided to blunder a pawn instead. Rook B4. Ah ha. That blunders an extremely easy-to-see

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:48,320
 checkmate in eight. Queen takes A A check. Knight B8. Queen takes B8 knight D8 is forced knight X

26
00:02:48,320 --> 00:03:08,000
 C7. Smothered checkmate. I'm better than my viewers.
