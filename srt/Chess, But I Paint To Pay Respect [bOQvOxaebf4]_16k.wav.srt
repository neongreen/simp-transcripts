00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 If a piece, not porn, dies, I draw that piece. I actually got this challenge from a discord

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,960
 channel's member, but it seems that for some reason, he deleted his message.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:22,880
 But anyway, we get a 157 from the US. The plan, is, simple. All I have to do,

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,680
 is to win this game, without losing any pieces, or capturing any pieces.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,840
 E4. Pushing pawns should be good, since there's no problem if they die.

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:48,800
 A5. The huare defense. D4. Rook A6. That blunders a rook. But of course, I cannot take it. Knight F3.

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:01:00,480
 E5. That still blunders that rook, but sadly, I'll take this pawn. Bishop before check. Very aggressive.

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:09,920
 C3. Bishop C5. Bishop F4. I mean that was a weird move, but who cares anyway.

9
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:18,880
 Rook D6. Well, I mean, at least you did move the rook away from my bishop.

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:30,800
 Queen C2. C6. Man, at this point, I'm pretty sure that this guy just hates his A-file rook for some reason,

11
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:39,040
 since it's only move 7, and that rook has been blundered, 6 times. But anyway, bishop E3 looks

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,720
 very natural, but I have a big feeling that he's just gonna sacrifice his rook for my bishop.

13
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:58,160
 Therefore, A4. Preventing B5 after bishop C4. Queen B6. Bishop C4. H5. Okay let's start an attack.

14
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:08,480
 Knight G5. Rook H6. Now do I take with the horsey, or do I take with the bishop? I'll go with the horsey.

15
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:21,520
 Rook HG6. Castle. King E7. Oh he's joining in the fun. Bishop G5 check. Now I'm pretty sure the engine

16
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,880
 wants him to take my bishop with his rook. But I mean, it doesn't seem very obvious to a 100 rated, right?

17
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:42,800
 Exactly. H4. Ah, finally, moved away from my pawn, but once again, that still doesn't solve the problem.

18
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:53,200
 But now, with that rook blocking the way, my knight's stuck. Are you serious? Knight H8.

19
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,960
 Rook takes E5. Yeah, that's good. That blunders this rook, this knight, and probably a lot of

20
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,880
 other things as well if I really start to capture. But of course, knight D2. All I can do, is to bring

21
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:19,600
 more pieces towards his king. Knight A6. Wow. I actually a bit regretted for leaving my bishop

22
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,480
 on G5 for him to sacrifice, but apparently he then decided that he doesn't hate his A-file rook anymore.

23
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,440
 Alright then, I won't retreat my bishop anymore. Knight F3.

24
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:53,440

25
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,280
 Yeah, that looks pretty similar.
