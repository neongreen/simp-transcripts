1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 100 rated chess, but only pawns can capture.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 This sounds absolutely impossible, but since it also gave me a very clear idea of what I have to do, you can count on me.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 We get a 123 from Italy.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Talking about Italy, better book your plane tickets right now.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 E4. The plan is very simple. I open up the position, he blunders his king, I checkmate without captures.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Therefore, d5. And then he doesn't capture.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 The worst thing is even I cannot capture because queen takes ends the video.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 Knight f6. Man I hate this game.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Now he takes. You know what? Change of plan.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 The plan is very simple. I'll trap his queen in the middle of the board, then he'll get desperate and resign from the game,

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 and even though a random queen capture ends the video, there is no way a guy who doesn't even have the gut to capture with a pawn can make a capture with a queen.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Absolutely.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Knight bd7.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Bishop c4.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 E5.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 This is possible, but there is no way a 100 rated guy knows about the French move, especially when he's an Italian.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 He played that move. In two f***ing seconds.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 You know what? It's fine, that move shocked me a little, but it's not like it does any harm to the video.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 F takes c6. As long as no random capture happens, everything is still under control.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 What the f***?

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:07,000
