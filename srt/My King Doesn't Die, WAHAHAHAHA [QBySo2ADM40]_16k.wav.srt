1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 100 rated chess, but if a protected piece, not pawn, dies, all of its protectors also

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,160
 have to die as soon as possible. And of course, this only applies to my pieces.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:23,520
 Very challenging. We get a 1 1 1 from Spain. E4. The rule doesn't apply on the pawns,

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,680
 therefore, why not go for a gambit? Well it's not a gambit just yet because my queen can still

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,640
 recapture, but I'm actually planning to sacrifice all of my pawns down the road.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:44,400
 D4. Ah ha, a counter gambit. Then why not go for? A counter counter gambit. I'm predicting

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,360
 a counter counter counter gambit, and then a counter counter counter counter gambit.

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:01:01,360
 Nevermind. Knight c6. E takes d5. Knight takes e5. Alright, now since the board is very wide and

9
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:08,160
 open, I strongly believe there is no way in hell that I'm losing this challenge. Therefore, mission,

10
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:18,240
 almost accomplished. Bishop f4. Knight g6. Knight c3. That blunders a bishop.

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:30,560
 G3. Very aggressive. Knight back to g6. Bishop d3. Ah ha, if he takes my knight, my f-pawn and my

12
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,080
 h-pawn also have to die, because they were protecting my knight, and then my rook also

13
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,280
 have to die, because it was protecting the h-pawn, and then my king also have to die,

14
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,560
 because it was protecting the f-pawn, but since my king can never die due to the game's rules,

15
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,840
 I have to either resign or end the video. Therefore, knight e5. If a piece has to die,

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:03,360
 make sure it dies. Alone. F5. Knight takes d3. Ha, now even if he takes my knight,

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,200
 no pieces will have to die with it, because as you can see, no one protects that horsey.

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:22,400
 C takes. Knight f6. Knight f3. Bishop g4. Rook f1. Bishop b4. Oh wait I blundered a fork.

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,840
 Alright, laugh all you want, I just want to say that I do blunder pieces sometimes,

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,840
 and after a long time playing against the 100 rated people, my skills have been seriously

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:44,240
 degrading. Well, I mean if he doesn't see it, it doesn't matter at all. Bishop takes c3.

22
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,920
 B takes c3. Again, even though my bishop dies, it was not protected by anything,

23
00:02:51,920 --> 00:03:02,800
 so no pieces have to die with it. Knight takes d5. C4. That blunders a fork. Oh, wait. Now there's

24
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,840
 queen e2 pinning my knight to my king, and even though I have queen e7, king f2 will win my knight,

25
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,440
 because if my knight moves, he can take my queen, and since my king will be defending my queen,

26
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,720
 I have to let my king die as well, which is not possible, so in conclusion,

27
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,520
 if he plays queen e2 right now, I will be forced to sacrifice my knight.

28
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,120
 Ha! Right square, but wrong piece. That blunders a woman.

29
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,840
 Rook takes, and he resigns at the same time.

30
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,080
 Mission accomplished.

31
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:56,720
