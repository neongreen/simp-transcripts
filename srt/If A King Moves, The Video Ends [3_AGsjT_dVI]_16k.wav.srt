1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 If a king moves, the video ends. Castling doesn't count. Day 50.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 End my misery please.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 You know what? I normally don't take on challenges that are too easy to accomplish.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But this time, just for this guy, I will take on this challenge.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And let's change it to...

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Castling. Also. Counts.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 I don't have anything else to say. Let's find an opponent.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 We get a 248 from Vietnam.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 E4.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 So in order to prevent his king from moving, I think I need to keep my opponent busy, and then checkmate him in the middle of the board.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Therefore, D5.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 E takes D5.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 C6.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 D takes C6.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 E5.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 C takes B7.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Very aggressive.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Bishop takes B7.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 F3.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Not very aggressive.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Bishop C5.

22
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Bishop B5 check.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Knight C6.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Queen E2.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Very aggressive.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But who cares anyway.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Bishop takes G1.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 If he can take my bishop with his rook, it means his king won't be able to castle kingside anymore.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 F4.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Okay then.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Bishop back to B6.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Even though he didn't take my bishop, he's still unable to castle, so it's actually a win-win for me.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 F takes E5.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Knight E7.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 E6.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Very aggressive.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 So I'm pretty sure the engine really wants me to castle in this position, but of course, that is against the rules.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 So I guess...

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 F6.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 I'll use his pawn as a shield for my king in the middle of the board.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Bishop takes C6 check.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Bishop takes C6.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Queen D3.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 He's offering a queen trade.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I think I still can checkmate his king without a queen, but it's going to be hard to prevent him from moving his king around during the process.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Therefore, queen C8.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 H4.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Again, very, aggressive.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Taking this pawn should be the best move, but it will result in a check, which may cause him to move his king.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 So I guess...

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Bishop takes G2.

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Rook G1.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 That blunders a rook.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Queen D7 check.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 That blunders a pawn.

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 But after queen takes D7, E takes D7, I'll have to move my king, which makes me a fool, for ending my own video.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 And there is no other way to resolve this check without moving my king.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Are you serious?

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Okay. It's fine.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Queen takes D7.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 There is still hope that he won't take my queen.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 I hate this guy.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 To be continued...

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Thanks for watching!
