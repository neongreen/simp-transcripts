00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 100 rated chess, but all of your pieces are frozen. Every time your pawn captures,

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,240
 you unlock the piece from his original file. Very interesting. We get a 1 26 from the US.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:22,800
 Alright, so I can only move pawns now. E4. It's fine though, I always have faith in the little

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:35,600
 guys. B6. Not very aggressive. D4. Bishop B7. Ah ha, if I lose my E pawn now, it means that my king

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,280
 will never be able to move anymore, which is extremely dangerous. Therefore, D5 is kinda forced.

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,200
 I'm predicting E5, all pass on, and he resigns because he thinks that I hacked into the game

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:01:00,240
 server. Well E6 is also very convenient though. D takes E6. Ha! You fool! Now I can activate my

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:09,520
 queen. F6. Weird move. I'll take this pawn as well. And even though my pawn was on the E file,

9
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,920
 the challenge said that I can only unlock the piece on the pawn's original file,

10
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,520
 and since that was originally the D pawn, I still don't have access to moving my king right now.

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:27,840
 Queen takes D7. Trading queens is obviously a bad idea, especially since she is my only tool

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:36,160
 right now. Therefore, queen F3. Everything is great, I have my queen now, let's just win this

13
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:44,400
 game real fast. Knight A6. C4. I have to be careful though, because if I lose a pawn,

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:53,600
 the piece on that pawn's file will never be able to move. Rook D8. Oh no! Is he gonna blunder queen

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,080
 D1? I mean after queen D1 queen takes D1, rook takes D1 is a check, and it forces me to move

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:11,360
 my king, which is against the rules. Nah. I'm just worrying too much. G4. I think I've just

17
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:20,720
 blundered something really bad, but I don't really see how. Bishop B4 check. Wait. Dude.

18
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:28,560
 I didn't even see that. He saw that queen D1 was blundering to queen takes D1, so he plays bishop

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,800
 B4 check, and even though knight C3 is best, I cannot play that due to the rules, but I have to

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,800
 play queen C3 instead, which distract my queen from guarding the D1 square, which allows queen

21
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:52,640
 D1 checkmate. What the f*** is this? Well I mean there is still a small chance that he actually

22
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:02,560
 doesn't even see the checkmate. Ha! No. Knight takes will also defend the D1 square. But of

23
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,480
 course, that is against the rules. B takes C3 is forced. Alright dude. Just one more move,

24
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:20,880
 and I can activate my knight to defend the checkmate. To my defense, I actually went to

25
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,600
 this guy's profile after the game, and then I saw, that he's played over 5000 chess games for the

26
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:48,720
 last 10 f***ing years, but somehow still stay at the 100 rated ELO. Very interesting.
