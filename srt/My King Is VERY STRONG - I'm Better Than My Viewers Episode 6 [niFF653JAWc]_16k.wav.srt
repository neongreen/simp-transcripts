00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 You are white? And I'll be honest, that doesn't look good for me. Welcome to episode 6 of I'm

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,280
 Better Than My Viewers, and the challenger this time is a guy called Le... Totoro. Man,

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,880
 I have absolutely no idea how to make the text-to-speech engine to read that name correctly.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,200
 And in fact, even I don't know how to read that name correctly. But anyway, the most obvious

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:32,160
 threat now is like knight f3 king moves bishop c6 checkmate, or knight f3 knight f6 checkmate,

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,320
 or bishop f6 bishop c6 checkmate, or knight c6 knight f6 checkmate, or so any other combinations.

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,920
 But the entire point is that it is very easy to take over all of these 4 squares around my king,

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,480
 which will result in a checkmate. Therefore, E takes f7 is kinda forced. That is the only

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,760
 move that gives my king a free square to move, and even though I'm sure that was the best move,

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,720
 there is still a checkmate in 5 for black in this position, so if you are interested,

11
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,520
 feel free to pause the video and find it, but the point is that my opponent is currently 1470 rapid,

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,920
 and his peak was 1600, which is to say he is not like any other people I have faced before,

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,040
 and starting a game at checkmate in 5 for him is probably not the way I want to do this.

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,480
 Knight g7. Ah ha, that move blocked away the only getaway square that my king has,

15
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:36,560
 therefore, I have to create another one. C pawn changed gender. Ah ha, the evaluation bar moved

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,560
 from mate in 5 to there is no checkmates anymore. I'll take his queen, and never mind,

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,040
 that was a bad move, there is another checkmate on the board. And then there is no checkmate again.

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,080
 Taking this bishop is just asking to be royal fought, and even though I have a rook that kill

19
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:01,520
 the guy, I don't want to live so passive like that, therefore, c8 changes gender. Dude, it's

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,720
 like every move I make is just blundering a checkmate of some sort, so I'm not gonna care

21
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:15,200
 about it anymore. Knight c6 check. Rook takes. Bishop takes. F pawn changes gender, and I've

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,640
 blundered checkmate again, and he's missed checkmate again. Rook takes king takes queen

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,040
 takes -26, that is actually the best case scenario I have ever been in this entire game,

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,400
 that means I'm making progress, and I'm only down 7 points of materials right now.

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:41,920
 Knight check. D takes, okay now it's 5, and only -20, so I have faith that I can turn this around,

26
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:50,720
 unless he pushes one of these pawns to make another queen. This is really bad. I only had 4

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,840
 rooks at the beginning, but he has 4 pawns that is very close to changing gender. Queen h1 check.

28
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,440
 I have to trade down a queen, can't let him have 2 queens when my king is so strong in the middle

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:12,320
 of the board like this. King f2, queen takes c1. B pawn changes gender. Taking this knight is

30
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:18,560
 blundering a queen, therefore, I can only take this bishop, and then from this point, the game

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,440
 continues for a few more moves, and in this position, something unexpected happened. I found

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,800
 out that taking this knight is blundering my queen just like before, so I see that there is nothing

33
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:36,720
 else I can do, and he can still make another queen very very soon, therefore, I did the thing that

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:44,480
 everyone would do at this point, which is, offering a draw. And funny enough, he accepted it, game

35
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,600
 drawn by agreement, not paid actor, and I'm still better than my viewers.

36
00:03:49,600 --> 00:04:04,220
