00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but it's no knight November, you cannot move your knights, and you must

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,120
 capture both of your opponent's knights before capturing any other pieces or delivering a check.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:22,720
 Ha! Too easy! We get a 1 52 from Cambodia. A4. D5. The plan is very simple. All I have to do,

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:32,240
 is just to trade down my bishops for his knights, and then he's dead. B4. Very aggressive. Bishop G4.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:40,160
 Knight F3 bishop F3 will be very convenient. Bishop B2. It's fine, he'll have to develop his

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,800
 knight sooner or later. E6. I mean it will be very problematic if he somehow decides to take this

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,680
 pawn because I cannot take his bishop back due to the rules, but who plays like that anyway?

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:00,880
 Right? My god that was close. A5. Since I cannot develop this bishop at the moment,

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:09,920
 I'll develop my rook instead. B takes A5. Rook K6. Dude, please just move one of your horses.

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:19,840
 Wow! That blunders a bishop, but sadly, I cannot take it. Somehow I have a feeling that this

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:31,840
 blunder wasn't an accident. I can already see that this video is so dead. Bishop E4. Queen C1.

12
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:40,800
 Rook C6. Rook A2. Rook C4. I'll be honest, I don't even know what I'm trying to do right now.

13
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:50,480
 Rook B2. Alright, I guess we have no other choices. Bishop A3. That blunders a bishop,

14
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,600
 but at this point, I'm willing to sacrifice a bishop just to bring his knight out.

15
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:04,400
 Or not. And if you look closely enough, my bishop is trapped. Have you ever seen a bishop

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,320
 being trapped while having a fork at the enemy queen and rook at the same time?

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:19,280
 H5. Okay freak that side, I'll get the other rook out instead. Rook takes B7. Well, at least now I

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,560
 can retreat my bishop. Rook takes B8. The challenge didn't say that I cannot lose my knight, so it

19
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:39,840
 doesn't matter. Queen A6. Rook B6. Queen A8. Rook B8. Queen C6. Rook B6. Queen D7. Well, at least

20
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,920
 he won't be able to continue attacking my queen. Rook C6. That blunders a rook for I don't know

21
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,720
 how many times already. But rook B4. After all that time, I finally have a chance to directly

22
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:03,360
 attack one of his knights. Rook C7. And my queen is trapped. Have you ever seen a queen being trapped

23
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,480
 in her own house and by two pieces that have been blundered for 20 moves in a row? But anyway. I'll

24
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,920
 take this knight first. Well I mean at least he should be able to see, that taking my queen right

25
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:25,200
 now is obviously blundering rook takes C1 backrank checkmate in one. Right? Rook C1 is against the

26
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,040
 rules. Rook B4 instead. It's fine, we're halfway there. As soon as I can take the other horsey,

27
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:41,440
 I'll be able to play the game like a normal person. Rook E7 check. King F8 is forced. Please

28
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,240
 don't tell me that you're gonna go rook E8 forcing me to take your rook and end my own video.

29
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,840
 F***!
