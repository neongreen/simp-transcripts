1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
 If a rook can move, the video ends. Well, I normally don't take challenges that depend on pure luck,

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,920
 but for some reason this guy gets 5 reactions for his idea, so I guess I'm missing out on something.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:22,240
 We get a 151 from Vietnam. So now knight f3 or knight c3 will just straight up end my video,

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:31,760
 but of course, there's nothing I can do about it. E4. Thank god. D5. Of course I need to keep him

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,560
 busy so that he won't develop his horses. Unless he's a tennis and gambit player.

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:51,680
 Yes. Taking the pawn back will just provoke knight c3. Therefore, c6. D takes c6. Very aggressive.

7
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,080
 But that's actually good for me. E5. Now he should be able to see, that knight f3 will

8
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,920
 just get kicked around by E4, so continuing to take should be his best choice. Right?

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:12,400
 Of course. But now what do I do? After I take his pawn, there's a big chance that he's gonna

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,480
 develop his knight. Oh well, I don't think I have any other choices anyway. Bishop takes b7.

11
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:29,680
 Man, obviously this mission is just based on luck. Bishop b5 check. Aha! Very aggressive.

12
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,800
 It's good that the video still hasn't ended yet. But what do I do now? Of course knight c6 is the

13
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:44,080
 best move, but I don't want to end my own video, same thing with knight d7, and bishop c6 is just

14
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:51,920
 losing a bishop since my knight can't take back. So I guess, king e7. Testosterone baby!

15
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:02,160
 Queen h5. Aha! He's obviously threatening queen takes e5 checkmate in 1. But what should I do?

16
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,720
 I mean a move like f6 will just get my video ended by a knight move.

17
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:17,680
 Okay, I guess, I should take a risk. Queen d5. Okay I know that this move only provokes knight c3,

18
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,720
 which attacks the queen and defend the bishop at the same time, but according to my experience

19
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,760
 playing against the 100 rated players, that move should be very hard to find,

20
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,280
 and I suppose he's gonna move his bishop or something instead.

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,920
 Ha! You see, my experience paid off. That blunders a bishop.

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:48,880
 Queen takes e5 check. I'll block. Oh wait, maybe blocking was not a good idea.

23
00:02:48,880 --> 00:03:00,800
 Yeah. Now when I take back, he's gonna move his knight. My bad. King takes d6. Well I guess he

24
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:11,680
 also can just move his pawn. Well, I kinda saw that was coming. So there's no what the f*** today.

25
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:26,280
