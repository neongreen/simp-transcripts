00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 I'm better than my viewers number 35, or maybe some other number, I don't remember.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,160
 You didn't need her anyway. Of course, a real man never says that he needs a woman.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,600
 Ladies and gentlemen and kids, welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers,

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,440
 and the challenger this time is a guy called Pelican Whisperer. I have no idea there was a

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,760
 job like that. I'll take this rook. I mean this woman is gonna die anyway, so why not just take

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,520
 a rook before she dies, and who knows, maybe he'll blunder his rook and my queen can get out alive.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,760
 Of course that doesn't happen. Taking this rook is fine, but I'll go for. C3. The plan is to use

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,840
 my bishop and capture 2 rooks at once, or even better, if he doesn't take my queen, I can move

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:01:00,240
 her out of danger. He takes it. I'll take his rook then. Rook takes C1. Knight B3. Rook B1.

10
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:07,680
 Wow. It seems like that blunders a rook, but since my bishop is literally forking 3 rooks at the same

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,800
 time, it basically can only take 1, which means it actually didn't blunder a rook. Rook B7,

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,760
 preventing rook B6 totally trapping my king. And then he goes rook A6 instead. Rook takes

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:30,400
 rook takes king B5 rook A2. I'll take this rook then. Rook takes B2. Dude, this guy told me that

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,080
 he is 500 rated, but somehow he saw that he doesn't need to take my bishop immediately,

15
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:44,160
 but instead take my pawn and fork 2 pieces. Bishop E4. Rook B3 king C4 rook B7 bishop E7

16
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,840
 bishop D2. The situation seems to be a draw because even though he has a lot of materials,

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,320
 they are just some useless same-color bishops. So I guess. G4. From this point onward,

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,600
 I'll try to play as aggressive as possible, and who knows, maybe he'll blunder his rook.

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:12,240
 King H2. F3. Rook C1. No way I can defend that pawn. Bishop E4. Centralizing my bishop,

20
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:22,960
 rook C3 king D5 rook C5 king E6 bishop G5 back to the original position. Okay. Here we go. E. 3.

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,520
 The plan is very simple. He takes my pawn, I take his bishop, and you may say that taking one of

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,440
 those useless bishops won't change anything at all? Well, I think you're right, but I still need

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:43,440
 to make progress. Bishop H6. Okay I guess it's 2 pawns for 2 bishops then. F4 bishop takes pawn

24
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,680
 takes bishop takes king takes. Okay I know that you guys always hate me skipping moves. But again,

25
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,040
 since there is absolutely nothing to show, we reached this position with him accidentally

26
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,760
 blundered one of bishops, and then I went. King G6. As you can see, Stockfish seems to really

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,280
 hate that move, it goes as far as saying that I'm blundering a checkmate in 30, but even after

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,720
 thinking about it for hours, I still don't know where the problem is, so if you have an explanation

29
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,440
 for this, please feel free to leave your comment below so that everyone will know about your

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:24,000
 wisdom. Rook G8 bishop takes rook king takes pawn. Draw by insufficient materials, therefore,

31
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:33,600
 I'm better than my viewers.
