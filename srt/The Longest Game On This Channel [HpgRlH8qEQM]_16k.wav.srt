1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 I'm not worse than my viewers.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 Well technically that is correct, but the name was I'm better than my viewers.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,920
 Porn Mountain.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,040
 Let's go.

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,400
 Ladies and gentlemen and gays, welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,160
 The series that I made so that my viewers will stop bats eating me, but apparently it didn't work.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,480
 And the viewer this time is a guy called...

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,680
 Ember.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,440
 I'll give a check first.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,040
 King takes.

11
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,560
 I'll take this porn.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,720
 Queen takes.

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,240
 That blunders a queen.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,000
 E6 double attack on the royal couple.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,280
 On second thought, maybe queen takes was actually a good move because queen e8 will just be

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,600
 blocking his king's way back to safety.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,880
 King e8.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,560
 I'll take that woman.

19
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,600
 Alright, now both of us are maidenless, the game truly begins.

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,200
 D takes e6.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,840
 I'll give another check.

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,280
 Who knows, maybe he'll decide to go king f7 blundering knight e5 check king f6's forced

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,160
 g5 checkmate in two with a pawn.

24
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,480
 Right?

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,400
 Of course it doesn't happen.

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,800
 I have to take that.

27
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,960
 King takes.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,320
 C takes b6, solidifying this side of the board.

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,160
 E takes d5.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,240
 Knight e5 check.

31
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,400
 King e8.

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,600
 I'll take this rook.

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,400
 I mean since he already had a queen in this game, if he can just let me also have a queen

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,740
 for myself, that will be the nicest thing ever happen to me.

35
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,080
 This horsey still dies.

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,600
 Rook a8 again.

37
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,980
 B5.

38
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,240
 Rook b6.

39
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,040
 There's not much I can do on that side anymore.

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,420
 I'll switch to this side.

41
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,840
 Rook takes b8.

42
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,960
 I'll take this rook.

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,960
 Rook takes.

44
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,640
 G5.

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
 Rook h7.

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,680
 A4.

47
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,480
 Rook back to h6.

48
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,840
 Wow.

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,500
 I have no idea why that was even an option, but I'm not gonna refuse it.

50
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,600
 Rook takes.

51
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,440
 And then we just shuffled our pieces around for the next 20 moves.

52
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,520
 F4.

53
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,560
 I know a lot of you guys hate it when I skip moves, but for real guys, there was absolutely

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,800
 nothing to see, except the fact that I managed to push a lot of pawns forward.

55
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
 Knight takes e4.

56
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
 F5.

57
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,680
 Double attacking his knight and his rook.

58
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,040
 Rook g5.

59
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,400
 I'll take this horsey.

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
 Rook takes f5.

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 D6.

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,920
 Rook d7 cd7 king d7.

63
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,480
 And then we shuffled pieces again, we traded rooks, I made a queen, I took his rook, I

64
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,960
 made another queen, I checkmated him.

65
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:52,440
 I'm better than my viewers.

66
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:59,440
 .
