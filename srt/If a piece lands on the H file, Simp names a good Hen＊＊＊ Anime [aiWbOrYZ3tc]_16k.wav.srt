1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
 If a piece, not a pawn, lands on the H-file,

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,840
 simp names a good adult anime,

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,840
 playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account,

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,840
 of course, the starting position, doesn't, count.

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,840
 Man, this video is so going to get demonetized.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,840
 But anyway, let's still find an opponent.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,840
 We get a 1 67 from Singapore.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,840
 Yes. In case you don't know, Singapore is considered to be the smartest country in the world,

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
 with an average IQ of 108.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,840
 Therefore, there's no way he's going to play such an absurd move like knight to H3.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,840
 Right?

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,840
 E3.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,840
 Aha! The threat is obviously Qh5.

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,840
 Therefore, G6.

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,840
 Well, since he's from Singapore, I don't think he's going to develop his queen first.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,840
 But you know, better be safe than sorry.

17
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,840
 Qf3.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,840
 Thank god I was playing safe.

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,840
 Now since the queen has occupied the f3 square, the move knight H3 is more likely going to happen.

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,840
 But sadly, there's no way I can prevent it.

21
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,840
 So I guess, knight f6.

22
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
 Bd3.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
 D6.

24
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,840
 It's starting to look like a king's Indian position.

25
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
 Knight c3.

26
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
 Bg4.

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:02:00,840
 I'm giving him my b7 pawn, just to get the f3 square free for his knight.

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,840
 And he didn't even take it.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,840
 Well at least now knight f3 is available.

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,840
 But in the other hand, now queen h4 is also a threat.

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,840
 I mean g5 looks like it prevents it, but after f3,

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,840
 I move my bishop away.

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,840
 Qxg5 will be very dangerous, and also open up the queen h4 threat once again.

34
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,840
 So I guess, let's just play normally.

35
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
 Bg7.

36
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,840
 There's no way he's going to play a weird move such as queen h4, right?

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,840
 Okay guys. Talking about such topic may get my video demonetized.

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,840
 So I guess, let's just end the video instead.

39
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,840
 Thank you for watching.
