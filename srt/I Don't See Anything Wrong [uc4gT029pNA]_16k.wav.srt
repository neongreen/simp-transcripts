00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 100 rated chess, but your pieces, and pawns, are always right, you cannot move them, leftward.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,880
 Now this is really challenging. E3, aha, since the challenge only forbids me from going to the left,

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,680
 I think it's safe to say, that I can go straight forward. Queen f3. Very aggressive.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,440
 D5, I mean if he can just blunder his bishop now, that would be very convenient. Sadly he's not a

5
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,480
 paid actor. C6, well if he takes my C-horn now, I actually cannot take back due to the rules,

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,600
 but he should be able to see, that it is so obviously blundering his bishop. Right?

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,560
 Of course. But still, that blunders a 4, oh wait I just blundered my horn.

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,880
 Yeah. That's right. I've just realized that if he does a desperado like that,

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,280
 I actually cannot take his bishop because I cannot move my pawns to the left.

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,120
 My bad. Knight f6, alright who cares about a pawn anyway, especially if it's just an Edward.

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,000
 Bishop d3. Knight a6, now my knight actually cannot move anymore because all of the other

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,800
 moves are going to the left, so if he can take it right now, that would be very helpful.

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,800
 Knight h3. Ah ha, I think he's just trying to say that if I can do it, he can do it too.

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:35,760
 Bishop d6. Ha, now it's my time to say, if he can do it, I can do it too.

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:43,760
 Knight f4. Very aggressive. Since I cannot castle due to the rules, I guess the easiest way to use

16
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,680
 my rook is h5. Okay now don't tell me that you're gonna take this pawn like what you did with your

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,120
 bishop. Ha, he probably thinks that if his bishop can survive last time, his knight can survive it

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:04,400
 too, but this time, I actually have. Knight takes d5, and in no world do you take my knight here,

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,200
 and when I say in no world, I actually included this one that we're living in as well.

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:20,640
 Thank you. B takes a6. G4. That blunders a pawn. Again, in no world do you take this pawn as well.

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,000
 Man, I guess this guy really hates the pawns. That blunders a woman but I cannot move my bishop

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,960
 to the left, so I guess, g6. Queen c4. Bishop e7. I mean if he really decides to take my pawn,

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:42,160
 I won't be able to take his queen because of the rules, but this is so obvious to see,

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:52,400
 that my bishop obviously defending my pawn. Right? Yes. King d7 is forced. No need to panic,

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,960
 I actually expected this from the beginning because we got the black pieces that has the

26
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,440
 king on the left side of the board, but the problem now is that there is actually no way

27
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,240
 for me to make any progress to attack him, especially when his king is still very safe

28
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:16,800
 in the middle of three pawns here. Ha! Nevermind. Mission accomplished.

29
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:29,120
