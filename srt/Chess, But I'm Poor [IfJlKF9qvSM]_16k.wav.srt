1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Chess, but you only have

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,860
 $690 and you pay your soldiers for every moves

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,180
 Blah blah blah

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,180
 Castling counts as moving. Oh, wait, wait, wait. That's a different comment. Oh

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:20,860
 I see. He didn't mention about castling. So let's make it

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:23,300
 $0

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,980
 Let's go. We get a 215 from India

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,020
 e4

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,700
 e5

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,220
 still theory

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:40,480
 Since I have a very limited budget. Let's try to play really aggressively and get some chances at winning quickly

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,700
 d4

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,180
 F6 that blunders a pawn

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,660
 F takes e5

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:58,260
 Aha, now it gets really tricky in this position. I have Queen h5 check g6

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,640
 Queen takes e5 check Queen blocks Queen takes h8 winning a rook

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:11,580
 But then he can go Queen g7 which forces Queen takes g7 trading the Queens which is for Queens move in a row

18
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,620
 which costs me

19
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,700
 $360 more than half of my entire budget and also

20
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,660
 Losing the Queen will make it harder for me to checkmate my opponent

21
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:29,060
 Well, but on the other hand if I don't do that, it's actually even harder to find a good plan now

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,300
 therefore

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,300
 YOLO Queen h5

24
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,100
 check

25
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:41,100
 King e7 that's a lot of testosterone right there

26
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:48,820
 Normally, I'll go Queen takes e5 check King f7 is forced Bishop c4 check d5

27
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:53,980
 Bishop takes d5 check Queen takes d5 e takes d5

28
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,260
 But that line requires me to move my Queen first which costs

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:05,500
 $90 and even though it wins my opponent's Queen it opens up too much space for his King and other pieces to move

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,980
 Which should make it harder for me to win quickly

31
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,440
 Therefore Bishop c4 I'm threatening Queen takes e5 checkmate in one and you know

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
 There's a chance that he cannot see it, right?

33
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,860
 Wow, he actually saw it

34
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:30,440
 Before the video continues in this position. There is a brilliant move according to stockfish

35
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,660
 So feel free to pause the video to try and find that move while I give you a couple of seconds

36
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,660
 *PAUSE*

37
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:46,020
 Okay for those of you who were able to find it

38
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,840
 Congratulations, and for those of you who just wants to enjoy the show

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,740
 It's Bishop to f4 the idea is if he takes there is Queen d5 check King e7 is forced

40
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,780
 Queen e5 checkmate if he just ignores it and play things like a6

41
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,220
 There is a forced checkmate in 8 or even if he finds the best move of Queen f6

42
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:16,900
 We can move our Bishop once again to g5 and he'll either have to sacrifice his Queen or go Queen g6 and blunder his

43
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:25,300
 King to Queen all the way back to d1 check King c6 Queen d5 check King b6 and Queen b5 checkmate

44
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,220
 But anyway, of course, I didn't see the brilliant move

45
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:38,340
 Queen f7 I was planning that he might decide to go Queen e7 to offer a Queen trade which blunders Queen

46
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,340
 d5 checkmate in one

47
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,900
 but instead he went for

48
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,820
 Knight h6

49
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,700
 That also blunders checkmate in two anyway

50
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:54,180
 Queen d5 check and I can pre move Queen takes e5

51
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,180
 Checkmate

52
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:07,060
 Fun fact I actually always analyze my games with Stockfish after it is done and this time I got to see

53
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,580
 this

54
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,540
 0.0% accuracy from my opponent

55
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,420
 Man, that was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my entire life

56
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,140
 Except for that day when my best friend was kicked in the balls by his girlfriend

57
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,660
 but anyway

58
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,660
 mission accomplished

59
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:42,720
