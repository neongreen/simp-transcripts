00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 If a piece or pawn captures a piece or pawn... oh wait...

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:16,800
 My bad. If a piece or pawn captures a piece of higher value, the video ends.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:28,000
 Too easy. We get a 173 from Brazil. Before the game begins, let's make this clear. King is 3.5,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,200
 which means, if a king takes a rook or a queen, the video ends. E4. D5. I'll take it.

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,440
 Queen takes. Knight c3. Of course my knight cannot take his queen due to the rules, but you know,

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,120
 he doesn't know about that, and there is also a chance that he's gonna play queen h5,

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,120
 allowing me to take his queen with my queen. Right? Queen d4. Well of course such a convenient

8
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:11,520
 thing cannot happen that easily. Knight f3. Queen f4. Very aggressive. D4. Bishop f5. That blunders

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:21,600
 a woman, but of course, I cannot take it, due to the rules. So I guess, bishop d3. Bishop takes d3.

10
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,120
 That blunders the woman again, and you know, I think I'm just gonna put a number right here,

11
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,080
 to see how many times that he is going to blunder his queen this game. Queen takes d3. Of course c

12
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:42,240
 takes will end the video, so queen takes was pretty much my only choice. Knight c6. Castle.

13
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,120
 Of course queen takes h2 will force me to end my video. But of course, no one plays like that

14
00:01:49,120 --> 00:02:00,320
 anyway. Right? Knight takes d4. Ha, that is of course still blundering the queen, but sadly,

15
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,840
 I can only take the knight. Well I mean if he can just blunder his queen this way instead,

16
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:15,120
 I can finally take it. Of course it doesn't happen. Knight db5. Okay, the game is almost done.

17
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,200
 Right at the moment that he sees my bishop is attacking his queen, he will move his queen away,

18
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:30,800
 which blunders the king instead. Knight g4. Ha, he's been blundering his woman for 7 times,

19
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:39,440
 and now he wants to use that same woman to checkmate me. G, 6. Okay, now in no world do

20
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:49,600
 you not see that your queen is under attack. I was wrong. King takes h2. 3.5 is bigger than 3.

21
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:58,480
 Aha! Finally! That saves the queen from danger. But sadly, he has to give back the king.

22
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:06,000
 Mission accomplished.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:18,160
