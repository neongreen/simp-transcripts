1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 If the same piece or pawn captures twice, the video ends.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,080
 Easy. We get a 100 rated from Japan.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,040
 Ha, this guy must be my first Japanese opponent on this channel.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,200
 The plan is simple. If something captures once, that thing dies.

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,000
 E4. E5. Still theory.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,840
 No more theory. Knight F6. Rook H3. Very aggressive.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:43,120
 D5. Knight F3. That blunders a rook, and nah since my bishop has already captured a piece,

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:51,840
 it cannot capture anything, anymore. G takes H3. Taking his pawn in any way will just provoke

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,960
 knight take C5, which will make his knight become a threat to the video. Therefore, bishop D6.

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:07,600
 Knight C3. Aha! D4. I mean taking his pawn was supposed to be the best move,

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,440
 but only if I can continue to take more pawns with that pawn,

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,560
 which is obviously, not the way this mission works.

13
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:23,120
 Knight E2. Knight takes E4. Now I have to be careful, because my knight cannot capture anymore.

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,960
 Knight takes E5. That knight also must not capture anything else, and funnily enough,

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,640
 it's actually free. Knight takes D4. Aha! That also blunders another knight,

16
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,640
 but since my bishop has already captured once, I'll have to go with, queen takes D4.

17
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:53,120
 Bishop B5 check. That blunders a bishop, C6, now he'll have to defend the checkmate threat,

18
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:59,360
 and let me take that bishop for free. Or just blunders his king instead.

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,280
 But since my queen has already captured once, that actually breaks the rules.

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,840
 You know what, I'm gonna respect the rules, since I think that this game is actually going

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,880
 well in my direction. Knight D7. By the way, he also blundered his bishop the same time he

22
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:28,160
 blundered his king. But of course, taking it also breaks the rules. H5. That blunders the king again,

23
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:38,640
 but still, knight F6. H6. Very aggressive. G6. I don't want to take anything, because I have

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,720
 to remember every pieces and pawns that already captured, so one more capture means one more thing

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:55,680
 I'll have to remember. H4. So we're going 2 pawns 1 file here. But anyway. Knight D5. I'm trying to

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:04,640
 set up a cool checkmate with this new knight right here. H5. Aha! If you can remember, that pawn

27
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,760
 actually captured my bishop in the very beginning of the game. Therefore, G5. As long as nothing

28
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:21,680
 crazy happens, you cannot end my video. Aha! Finally. Now queen F2 is checkmate in 1, without

29
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,240
 breaking the rules. But actually, I've already gone this far with my second knight, so let's just

30
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:35,440
 continue with my own plan, and go for a better checkmate instead. Knight F4. And if you're already

31
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,400
 watching this long into the video, I just want to say that I actually have another channel,

32
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,240
 featuring some very random games I find on the internet, so please feel free to check it out at

33
00:03:46,240 --> 00:04:04,240
 any time you want. F takes E4. Queen to G1. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

34
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:12,240
