 100 rated chess, but your king is paranoid, he needs Edward, Frank and the queen as his bodyguards,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,720
 they all must always be within one square from the king. I normally don't take on super easy

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,320
 challenges like this one, but since anime profile pictures are good for thumbnail clickbaits,

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,840
 this one gets a priority. D4, for those of you guys who don't know, this is Edward, this is Frank,

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,840
 and you probably already knew about the queen, and these 3 pieces need to always be next to the king.

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:40,160
 D5, bishop F4, nothing suits D4 openings more than the London system, and don't you mention

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:52,320
 any movies here. Knight C6, aha, against knight C6, I usually like to go, C4. D takes C4. D5, oh,

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,560
 wait. I think this entire idea of C4 D C4 D5 is actually a mistake, because now he has knight B4,

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,920
 which threatens knight C2 check, and if I take his knight, my queen violates the rules,

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,600
 or if I move my king, Frank will no longer be touching the king, which also ends the video.

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,840
 Yeah, this is really bad. I mean he should be able to see that knight C2 is blundering a horsey,

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,520
 but of course I won't take any risks this time. Knight A3. Alright, now queen takes D5 is also a

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,720
 big problem because she'll be starting a fight against my woman, but he should be able to see

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,480
 that it will blunder a horsey to queen A4 check with a fork. Right? Actually, I just realized

15
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,960
 that after queen A4 bishop D7 queen takes B4, he also has E5 double attacks on my queen and my

16
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,480
 bishop, and maybe this guy actually did all the calculations even faster than me before taking

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,920
 my D pawn. But anyway, I need to stop the women's war. In no world do you go queen takes G2 here

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:08,080
 because my bishop cannot take your queen. Of course, that blunders a pawn. Ha, now everything

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,080
 is fine, he cannot take my G pawn when his knight is being attacked, and since knight D3 is obviously

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,920
 a huge blunder.

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:37,760
 F*CK!
