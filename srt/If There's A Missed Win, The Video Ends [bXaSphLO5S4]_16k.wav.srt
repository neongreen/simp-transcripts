1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 If the opponent plays a missed win, the video ends.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,480
 Yes! Finally! A nice guy who gives me an easy challenge. And you know,

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,800
 since I think this challenge is so easy, let's make it. Anyone? Because you know,

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,000
 I'm a generous man. Let's go!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,480
 We get a 101 from the US. With premiumed membership.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,640
 The plan is simple. I win, and my opponent doesn't win. Because if my opponent doesn't win,

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
 there is no missed win, and if I win, there is also no missed win.

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,360
 D4, let's just play safe and slowly get our win.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,720
 E6. Not very aggressive. I was planning to go bishop F4 London system,

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,000
 but since he's not very aggressive. E4.

11
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,840
 Knight F6. E5. Need to make sure I always take any possible advantages.

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:08,400
 Knight E4. Ah ha, he's baiting me into playing F3, thinking that the knight is trapped after

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,880
 knight G5 and H4, but he actually got queen H4 check, G3, knight takes G3, H takes G3,

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,200
 and queen takes H1. Therefore, bishop D3.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,960
 Bishop B4 check. That blunders a piece. C3.

16
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:36,400
 A desperado. Knight takes. Alright, now since I've won a piece, let's try to be extra careful

17
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,040
 from now on, because we can never know, when stockfish is gonna pull the trigger.

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,960
 Castle. Knight F3.

19
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,400
 D6. So in this position, there is a brilliant move for white, or actually, just kinda brilliant,

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,080
 since it's pretty obvious if you're an experienced player, so feel free to pause the video right now

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,760
 to find the move, while I don't give you any seconds to do so, and the move is bishop takes

22
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,640
 H7, check. This is called the Greek gift sacrifice, and if you couldn't spot the move,

23
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,200
 don't feel bad, because you will definitely learn this stuff sooner or later.

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:27,600
 King takes H7. Knight G5 check. Wait what? So it seems like this guy knows about the line.

25
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:36,800
 Not gonna lie, I'm actually scared now. Queen G4. This is very problematic, because he can just

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,800
 blunder checkmate at any time now, but if I cannot see it, stockfish may give me a missed win,

27
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:51,760
 which makes me a fool, for ending my own video. F6. Okay that should blunder checkmate somewhere.

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:03:00,960
 But I can't see it. Alright who cares, knight takes E6 check. I will win this queen,

29
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:09,600
 and if that is a missed win, I will just blame it all on luck. King H7. Ah ha! I was about to

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,040
 pre-move knight takes D8, which very much could have been a missed win, because the best move

31
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:37,760
 was supposed to be, queen takes G7, checkmate. Mission accomplished.
