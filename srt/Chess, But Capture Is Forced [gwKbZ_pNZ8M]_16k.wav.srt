00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Last time when I make this video, a lot of you guys were mad that I just decided to end the video, instead of keep on playing down a queen.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 So today, I'll do it again, and this time, I'll keep on playing, no matter what happens.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 100 rated chess, but I take, when I can.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Let's go.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 We get a 2 or 4 from Israel.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 E4.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Ah ha. Last time I played E5, and then when H4 comes, I ragequit, since I have to lose my queen, for just a flank pawn.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 I mean a flank pawn is not even a real pawn, it can only capture one way, since the other way is going outside of the board.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 So it's more like half a pawn, which is pretty much the most useless piece of trash on the chess board.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Therefore, H5.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Nothing can be wrong with this move.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 And in fact, I actually spent like 10 minutes in real life, trying to analyze all of the situations that can happen in the early game,

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 which then led to a conclusion, that H5 has to be the best move.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Knight C3.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 A6.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Trust me, nothing can go wrong with this move also.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Knight F3.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Knight H6.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Well, since knight F6 may get forced to take on E4, which blunders a knight, and I'm not pushing my E4 neither,

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 so this is pretty much the only spot for my knight to stand.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And believe it or not, this is actually still in my preparation.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Knight E5.

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Very aggressive.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Now it's officially out of my prep, I have to play it a bit more seriously.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 D6.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 I didn't push E6 earlier, because I was worrying that after E5, I'll have to take, which opens up my queen,

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 which forces queen takes D2 next, but now there is a knight on E5, I think it's worth a shot at taking some center space.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Knight C4.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Knight D7.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Now even if he pushes E5, I can just take the pawn, and my queen is not opened up anymore.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Queen takes H5.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 It's fine, losing a pawn in such a difficult challenge is nothing much.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 E5 now once again becomes a threat.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Therefore, B5.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Knight A5.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Very aggressive.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 G6.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Nothing can go wrong with pushing a pawn.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 Queen H3.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 OK.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 OK.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Here comes a big chance of winning his queen.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Knight E5.

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 That is a very risky move, so if he doesn't blunder his queen, I think I'll have to move my knight back for safety reasons.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 B4.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Yes.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Bishop takes H3.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Wow.

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 I actually can't believe that this is going way better than the last video.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 And the best part is, there's a chance that he will just resign.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Right.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Now.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Knight B7.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Wait what?

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 That blunders another piece.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 But since bishop takes G2 is forced, I'm actually losing my queen instead.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Are you serious?

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 Alright.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 It's fine.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Bishop takes G2 is forced.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Knight takes D8.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 I'll take the rook.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 And now the worst part is he can just take his knight out, but I have to sack my bishop on E4.

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Nevermind.

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Rook takes D8.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 On second thought, maybe I should have taken it with my king.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Knight D5.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Yeah, I really should have taken with king.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 But anyway, bishop takes E4 is kinda forced.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 This way after he takes back with his D pawn, I won't have to let my knight die anymore.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 D takes.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Yes.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 King D7.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 I mean the king should have some fun too.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Right guys?

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Bishop H3 check.

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 E6.

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 Knight F4.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 Knight F3 check.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 King E2.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Perfect.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Knight G1 check.

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Who cares about the free pawn anyway.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Trading down pieces is better, since I'm up a lot of material.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 King F1.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Knight takes H3.

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 Knight takes.

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Knight F5.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Keep trade down too.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Oh wait I blundered.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Now if he moves his knight away, I'll have to take this pawn, which leads to this pawn next, and I'll lose my rook.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 Yeah.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 My bad.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 I was so excited that victory is already very close by.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Rook takes H2 is forced.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 Alright.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 It's fine.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Even though I'll lose my rook, I believe that I can still win, if I can make good use of my king.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Because you know, the anti-chess rules actually don't work on my king, since he cannot take anything that is defended.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 King G1.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Oh he still didn't take my knight.

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Rook takes F2 is forced.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 King takes F2.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 Knight E7.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Still equal in pieces, still good situation for me.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Bishop E3.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Bishop G7.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 E5.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 I'll take with bishop.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Even better, now I can trade down another piece.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Or win a full rook.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 And he resigned.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Wow.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 I can't believe that I did that.

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Mission accomplished.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:37,000
