1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 100 rated chess, but it's rushy. You may only play moves to and from the E-file.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,400
 Very difficult, but nothing is impossible. We get a 100 rated Brazilian.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:20,320
 E4. A move that is from the E-file and also to the E-file, is definitely following the rules.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,040
 E5. I mean he doesn't have to follow the rules, but I respect it.

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,280
 Bishop E2. I actually wanted bishop C4, but as bishop from F1 to C4 is not connecting with the

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:46,240
 E-file, I need to move him to E2 first, and then continue from E2 to C4. Knight C6. Bishop C4.

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:54,880
 D6. Since I obviously cannot move any pawns, now I can only choose to move something between my

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:03,200
 queen and my knight. And I'll choose my queen. Queen E7. I wanted to go queen F3 aiming for a

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,480
 scholar checkmate, but since his queen is already defending his F-pawn. Queen E3 instead. Since I

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:17,600
 can only use my light bishop, my queen will help with controlling the dark squares. Bishop E6.

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,480
 Ah ha. I can take his bishop as it is standing on the E-file, but as I only have so many pieces

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:33,680
 to play with. Trading is definitely not a good idea. King D8. Ha. I bet that was a failed attempt

13
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,280
 to castle his king, so even though I really want to castle right now to flex that I can play the

14
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,920
 move. Bishop F3 first. I need to move my knight first, and then when I can finally show him the

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,760
 proper way to castle, he'll probably cry while realizing that I'm actually much better than him,

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,560
 and then decide to run away with a resignation. Or I don't even have to do that.

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,040
 This guy was so mad at the fact that he cannot perform the move, so he resigned.

18
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,080
 But anyway, mission accomplished.

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:24,240
