1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 100 rated chess, but progress is hard, after every 2 moves forward, you must make 1 move

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 backwards. Sounds absolutely impossible, but as we all know, I'm not a coward. We get a

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,440
 164 American. E4, that is 1 move forward. E5. Ah ha, so my favorite move right now against

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,860
 the 100 rated players is D4, but after D4, I'll have to make a backward move, and apparently

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:38,300
 since my pawns cannot do that, I'll have to end the video instead. Therefore, knight C3.

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,060
 Queen H4 will be very dangerous, but since I'm already defending my E pawn, there's absolutely

7
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:53,340
 no reason to play such a move. Right? Nevermind. Alright, knight B1 is kinda forced. This game

8
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:01,380
 is going very wrong very quickly. Thank you. He is obviously asking for G3 E queen E4 queen

9
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:11,120
 H1, but sadly, I'm not that stupid. G5. Very aggressive. G3. In no world do you take this

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,360
 pawn and force queen E2 because I have to make a backward move which blunders a rook.

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:27,660
 Of course. Backward move. Queen G2. Bianchetto. Queen my queen. Queen F6. Knight C3. Knight

12
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:38,280
 C6. Knight D5. Queen E7. That blunders a woman, but sadly, I have to make a backward move.

13
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,720
 Queen back to F6. Ah ha, he's obviously provoking me to go back to D5, and you know what, there's

14
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:55,120
 no way I'm refusing that. Queen E7 again please. Queen E6. Ha, that still blunders the queen

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:03,700
 regardless. Knight C7 triple fork. King E7. Testosterone. Now I have to make a backward

16
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:10,420
 move, and it just happens, that there is knight takes E6. I bet he doesn't have enough testosterone

17
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:23,200
 to take with the king. Man. I really underestimated him. Bishop C4 check. King D6. D3. B5. That

18
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,200
 blunders a pawn, but again, backward move. Bishop A6. F4. Let's see if he knows about

19
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:44,080
 the famous French move. Ha. No. F takes E5 check. No way he's taking with king here.

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:54,640
 Queen F1 is forced. Knight takes C2. That blunders a horsey. Knight F6. Bishop G5. Alright, now

21
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,600
 please just make a random move and blunder queen F6 checkmate in 1. Sadly he's not a

22
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:07,640
 paid actor. And in this very position, there is a very easy to see checkmate in 10 for

23
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,520
 white, so if you're interested, please feel free to pause the video right now to find

24
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,760
 the checkmate, while I don't give you any seconds to do so, because I already saw that

25
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,920
 checkmate from 10 moves earlier. I'll take that horsey. Spoiler alert, that move wasn't

26
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,520
 the correct move for the checkmate in 10, I wanted to keep the puzzle for you guys to

27
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:37,600
 solve on your own. F6. Ah ha, that blunders a king to queen F6. King D5. Bishop B3 checkmate

28
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:50,560
 in 2, but sadly, I have to go backward. F5. Bishop B3. Rook HF8. Queen F4. Checkmate.

29
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
 Mission accomplished.
