00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 *clapping*

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Men and women, my name is Detective Simp, and welcome to episode 3 of Fake the ELO.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 As usual, the rules are simple. I play against a Discord member.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 They play weird to hide their ratings, and then I'll make a guess for their ELO.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 So far, I've won two times, and about the challengers...

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Well, let's just say they don't have what it takes.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 But anyway, let's go. Today's challenger is an American named B3-3 Thuvan.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 F3. Well, such a shame that he didn't play B3 as his first move.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 E5.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 C3. Not very aggressive.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 D5. After those two moves, I'm pretty sure that he is below 600,

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 because if he was a high-rated player who is trying to hide his ELO, that player wouldn't go for two moves in a row.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Qc2. Aha, now the aggressive moves are kicking in.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Nf6.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 E3.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 E4.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Be2.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Bd6.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Na3.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 You know what? This is getting kind of boring, and if this scenario keeps on,

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I will never know anything about his ratings, and this video will be very long, which means it will take a lot of time to edit.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Therefore, Ng4. I'm threatening Fxg4 Qh4+ G3 Bxg3.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Is he gonna see that even if he takes my knight, his king can move away from the check instead of G3,

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 or is he gonna get scared of it and leave his F pawn there?

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And he chose an even worse situation. Qh4+ check. Well at least he should see G3. Right?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 That blunders a king. Nf2+ check. Kd1 is forced. Nd3 double check.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Kd1. And now Qe1 is such a disgusting checkmate, but sadly, I haven't gathered enough information about this guy.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Therefore, Dxe4. I mean at least he should be able to see that my knight is very dangerous here and should be taken care of immediately. Right?

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Okay, I guess he has an idea of a Zxg, which means in-between moves in English.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 But still, that blunders a pawn. Alright, now he should really take my knight.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 I guess it will never happen. You know what? Let's get another blunder on the board. Bxh3.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I'm sure a lot of people are very mad that I haven't taken his rook for like a hundred moves,

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 but in my point of views, beginners are not very friendly with rooks, so there is no point in doing so.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 But anyway, is he gonna see Nxh3 that also defend the f2 square, or is he gonna take with his rook and forces me to fork him with my knight?

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Again, none of the above. Fun fact, there is a checkmate in 11 moves in this position, so feel free to pause the video to find the checkmate.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But of course, I don't give a sh*t about such madness. Exd3. I'm sure there'll be some people go like,

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 "Oh you noob you didn't see such simple checkmate in 11 moves!" And yeah, you are absolutely correct.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Qxd3. Bg4 check. Well at least see the knight block. Nevermind.

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Qxh1, Nxe2, Bxc2, Qxc2, Nc6, b3, there we go, long castle.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Alright, very simple tactic here. Qg4 check, and forks my bishop at the same time.

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 And he doesn't see it. Dude. The game has lasted for 20 moves, and he hasn't seen any tactics at all.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 You know what? Let's just leave the bishop there, and hope that someday he'll see the fork.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 a5. Bb2. Aha! Finally! A tactic. I'll go all the way back.

45
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Yeah, now he sees the fork. And at this very moment, I got a power outage, so the game was forced to stop right here.

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 But of course, I believe that was enough information to have a good guess.

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 These were the two only moments in the game, a discovered attack and a fork that he missed for like 200 moves.

48
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 And unlike last two videos, where people accuse me of cheating, this time, I will give an answer first.

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I'm guessing... 3, 5, 1. Let's see.

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000

 [Beep]

53
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Oh well, I guess he did a great job of hiding his elo from me.

54
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 [Beep]

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Ha! Nevermind. I'm right again.
