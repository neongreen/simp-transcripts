 100 rated chess, but your viewers think you use paid actors. To prove them wrong, you must finish

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,720
 the game before the opponent blunders a total of 10 points of materials. Finally, after all that

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:20,080
 time, someone finally allows me to play the game, like a normal person. We get a 168 from Poland.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:29,760
 E4. E5. Queen H5. The plan is very simple. Since I cannot let my opponent blunders 10 points of

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,200
 materials, the best plan is obviously to quickly checkmate his king before he can end my video.

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:46,080
 Knight F6. Ah ha, that blunders a pawn, so it is now 1 point out of 10. Queen takes E5. It's fine,

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,280
 we still have 9 more points to spend, and if he can just block with the queen right now to allow

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
 a queen trade, that will definitely prevent a queen blunder from happening in the future.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,760
 And then he decided to block with a bishop. Bishop C4. It's fine, at least with my queen

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,480
 in the middle of the board, he'll get scared and not play risky to blunder too many things.

11
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:17,840
 D6. Queen G3. Alright, now knight E4 queen G7 is absolutely amazing because that is just a

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,360
 pawn trade, which does not add a number to our counting. Or he can just only blunder his pawn

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:33,360
 and doesn't take my pawn. I'll take it. Well, it's still fine, now if he can just go bishop F8

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,320
 to blunder his king, and even though it also blunders the rook and the F pawn, we'll only

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,960
 be at 8 out of 10, but I get a checkmate to win the challenge. Of course that doesn't happen.

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,560
 That blunders another pawn. 3 out of 10, this is getting a bit serious.

17
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,600
 King D7. Alright, so in this position, there should be a forced checkmate at his king.

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:18,720
 I found nothing. Queen E6 check. King E8. Alright, change of plan. Queen F7 king D7 queen E6 king E8

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,200
 queen F7 king D7 draw by repetition. The challenge only said that I have to finish the game,

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
 not winning it, therefore, mission, accomplished.

21
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:44,340
