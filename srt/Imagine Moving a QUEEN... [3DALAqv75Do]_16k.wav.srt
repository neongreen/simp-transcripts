 100 rated chess, but you are playing Clash Royale. Every piece costs its value in elixir to move,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,360
 and you generate 2 elixir per turn. You start with 1 elixir. In case you don't know,

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,880
 I don't even know what Clash Royale is. We get a 1 23 from the Philippines.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:29,360
 Knight f3. Well, since I only have 1 elixir. d5. d4. Ha, plus 2 baby.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:36,000
 But of course 2 points are still not enough to move a piece. c5. The game will become very

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,040
 difficult if he gets to develop normally and I have to continuously push these pawns, so if he

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,800
 can just advance his knight forward to create a tempo for me to push my pawn, that will be extremely

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:56,160
 convenient. Well, extremely convenient. f6. Well I mean if he can also just leave his knight right

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:07,520
 there and let me make another pawn move. Free horsey. f takes c5. I'll take this pawn. On

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,800
 second thought, maybe that wasn't a great idea as now he'll have a reason to get his queen out,

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,040
 which may end up really bad for me as I haven't stacked a lot of elixirs yet.

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:26,240
 My bad. But anyway. Knight c6. I mean who knows, maybe he'll blunder that woman immediately after

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,840
 getting her out. Even a paid actor wouldn't be playing like this. I'll take that woman.

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,560
 Bishop e3. And in this very position, something unexpected happened. Unlike you guys, I didn't

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,680
 have an elixir counter during the game, so I had to calculate everything inside my head while

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,800
 playing the game at the same time, and in this very position, I lost my counting.

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:02,000
 Ha. Nevermind. Mission accomplished, and two days ago, I posted a video with a small game inside of

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,120
 it. For those of you who haven't watched this video, I would suggest you pause this video right

19
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,320
 now and go to the link in the description to watch it yourself, and then come back to this video

20
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,680
 later for the real answer. This is the polls result as of the moment of making this video,

21
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,800
 and the real answer is, I was playing white,

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,160
 and there is this one guy who absolutely scared me to death with his detailed explanation.

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:39,920
