00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 100 rated chess, but every piece, not pawn, must land on the H-file, at least once.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,320
 Well even though I'm wondering why he chose the H-file instead of the A-file in his name,

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,920
 let's just assume that his girlfriend's name starts with an H. For those of you who don't know,

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,320
 this area, is called the H-file, which means I'll have to move all the pieces I have to that area,

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:32,080
 at least once. E4. Knight C6, I mean this knight has to be my biggest problem in this video,

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:41,680
 so I really need to move it over there before it dies. Knight C3. Knight E5. Knight F3. Ah ha,

7
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,040
 taking that knight and then E5 is obviously the best continuation, but since my knight hasn't

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:55,920
 landed on the H-file yet, it is not allowed to die. Therefore, knight G6. Alright, just one more move,

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,840
 and I can play with the other pieces. D4. E6, knight H4 next, and don't tell me that you're

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:14,400
 gonna play G6 and absolutely destroy my plan. Thank you. Knight H4. Alright, one down, 6 more to go.

11
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:24,720
 Bishop C4. G6, the plan is very simple. Bishop H6, bishop takes H6, knight takes H6, knight takes

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:34,480
 H4, queen takes H4, and then guess what, I only have 3 more pieces to worry about. Castle. Bishop

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:45,200
 H6. Of course he'll take. Nevermind. Knight F5. G4. Very aggressive. Knight H4 again, man these

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,240
 bishops have been staring at each other for like an eternity. D5. You know what, since he really

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,520
 doesn't want to take me, I'll take him then, I mean there is a chance that he'll just take with

16
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:06,960
 his queen and blunder this horsey right here. Right? Nevermind. Knight H6. Dude, on second

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,320
 thought, I think that most 100 rated players would have just immediately taken with their queens

18
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,520
 instead of their rooks, so the fact that he actually spotted that his queen was being overloaded with

19
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,120
 defending 2 pieces at once, makes me think that he is not really a 100 rated player.

20
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,360
 Wow. As soon as I said that, he blundered his woman. Knight takes F3 royal fork. Alright,

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,600
 now comes the moment of truth, please don't resign just because of a queen.

22
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:46,160
 Well I mean after I take his queen there is a second fork of his rook and his bishop too,

23
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,120
 so a resignation is actually an acceptable decision. Therefore, mission failed, successfully.
