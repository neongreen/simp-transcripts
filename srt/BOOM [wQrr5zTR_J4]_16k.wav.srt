 If a piece, or pawn, lands on c4, your king gets blown up.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:13,680
 Ha! Too easy! We get a 172 from South Africa. Well I mean he can just play c4 right now and

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,400
 immediately end the video, but as you can see, there's nothing I can do about that.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:28,080
 Thank god! Now c4 and bishop c4 are both threats to end the video, therefore, d5, well I mean he

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,000
 can still play c4 and gambit his e-pawn, but most people don't play like that. Right?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,600
 Of course, but that move is actually also very bad, because it means that he really wants to

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,800
 go bishop c4. Therefore, I'll reinforce my d-pawn. This mission is being much more difficult than it

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,360
 should be because I started with the black pieces, but if he can just push his e-pawn

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:01,040
 instead of taking my pawn, that will be very convenient. Well, I guess we can all agree,

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:08,560
 that sometimes very convenient things can also happen in our lives. b5. Ha! Now c4 is just

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:17,760
 blundering a pawn, and bishop c4 is not even an option. Queen e2. Bishop f5, well I mean if he

12
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:26,240
 can also blunder his c-pawn next, that will also be very convenient. d3. Oh no no no no no no no no!

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,760
 We can clearly see that he's in a very prepared position to play c4, which ends the video,

14
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:38,560
 and as far as I can see, there is only one way to prevent it from happening. Bishop takes d3.

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,720
 Please take back with your c-pawn, and since I'm attacking your queen, in no world do you play c4

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:54,320
 here. Queen takes. I guess that's fair enough. Knight d7, c4 is just blundering a pawn now,

17
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,600
 and since I'm also attacking his e-pawn, there's no chance for that to happen right now.

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:09,040
 c3. Ha! Not even close. I'll take this pawn, queen c4 is obviously not an option.

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,760
 Queen f5. Queen d6. I'm down for bishop f4 f6 and we trade everything because this is getting way

20
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,520
 more dangerous than it should have been, and since he's been consistently threatening to end my video,

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,600
 I think we can all agree that he is not a paid actor. Wait!

22
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:43,520
 Well, I'll take the free win then, and he's definitely not a paid actor.

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:50,960
