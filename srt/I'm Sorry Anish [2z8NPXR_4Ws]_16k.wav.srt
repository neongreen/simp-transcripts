00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 100 rated chess, but you are Anish Giri. You must always play for a draw, even if you have a winning position.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 For those of you guys who don't know who Anish Giri is, he is a Russian chess grandmaster, and to be honest, he is quite a handsome guy.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Not as much as I am though, and when you google search for "Anish Giri draw", there are all sorts of stuff like

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 "Anish Giri draw meme" "Anish Giri draw percentage" "Anish Giri 14 draws" "Anish Giri offers draw" "Anish Giri always draws" etc.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Therefore, we draw today. Opponent is a 1-24 American.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 E4. E5. Still theory.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 D4. Some people may say that creating tension early is not the way to play for a draw, but trust me, I have a plan.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 F6. I'll take this pawn.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 F takes. That blunders a rook. Qh5 check.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Ke7. Ah ha, so he can actually see that G6 allows Qe5 Qh8, but sadly, Ke7 is even worse.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Qxe5 check. Some people may say that winning materials is not the way to play for a draw, but I mean it's just a pawn anyway,

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 and he is probably not gonna care about it and resign, right?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Kf7 is forced. Bc4 check.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Kg6. That blunders Qf5 checkmate in 1, but sadly, since I'm playing for a draw, I cannot checkmate him.

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Nc3. B5. Very aggressive. That still blunders the king, but again, I cannot do that, so I'll take another pawn instead.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 This is going very wrong very quickly.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Bb7. That blunders the king again, and you know what, I'm just gonna put a number right here as I always do,

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 and let's see how many times is he gonna abandon his king to death.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Nf3. Bb4. Again, very aggressive.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I'll castle, and fun fact, Stockfish says that all of my moves so far, are all blunders, because I did not checkmate his king.

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 H5. Nd5. I'm provoking c6 Nxb4 cxb5 trading the bishops, because as you can see, trading is the best way to get a draw.

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Nevermind. This guy just keeps making so many aggressive moves towards my territory, while still making sure to blunder his king after every move.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Let's go here. I mean now my bishop is so close to his king, he should be scared and move his queen closer to defend him. Right?

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Dude. There was only one square that is further from the king, and he chose to go to that exact square.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Rd1. I can't think of anything else. My eyes just keep looking at queen f5 and my brain refused to think of any other moves to continue the game,

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 and now I know that playing for a draw can be so freaking difficult.

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Rk6. That blunders a rook, but again, I'm playing for a draw, so winning a rook is not really an option because he may just resign.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 c3. Ne7. Ah ha. Finally. He has finally saved his king, but the cost is that now he is blundering a rook, a bishop, a knight, and a royal fork.

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 I'll take that knight. I mean winning a piece with a royal fork is normally not the way to go for a draw, but please bear with me,

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 it is time to execute my plan that I said in the beginning of the video.

31
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Kh7. Well that blunders the king again but I'm not gonna do that.

32
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Knight takes c8. Rook takes c8. Alright, now as you can see, I'm being up an entire queen, it's time to

33
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 offer a draw. And he immediately accepts it. So pro tip for you, and Arnish as well if you're watching this video,

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 next time if you want a draw, just win the enemy's queen, and then you can offer a draw. I promise you, they will most likely accept that draw immediately.

35
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:46,000
