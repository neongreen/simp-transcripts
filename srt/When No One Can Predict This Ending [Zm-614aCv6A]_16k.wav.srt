 100 rated chess, but you cover the screen so you can't see the opponent's side of the board.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,280
 This sounds like an absolutely horrible idea and I'm gonna lose a bunch of subscribers after I've

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,480
 lost my game. But of course, I'm not a coward. We get a 100 rated guy from the Philippines.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,760
 For context, I'm literally covering this part on my monitor, but for the video's sake,

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,320
 I will only make it blurred so that you guys can keep track of what was happening up there.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,920
 Something was moved. Pushing center pawns is too dangerous as I literally cannot see the so-called

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:46,880
 center. B6. Something was moved. Bishop B7. Queen H5. Ah ha. This is his third move,

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,800
 so I suggested the first two moves were E4 and bishop C4, which means he is actually threatening

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,840
 a checkmate in 1. Therefore, G6 is kinda forced, and I mean if he can just blunder his queen right

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:09,120
 now when I can still see it, that will be very convenient. Well, very convenient. I'll take a

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,400
 woman. Bishop takes H5. I have no idea how he could've taken with his bishop when it was supposed

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,560
 to be on C4, but I guess there is no need to think about it. Bishop G7. Something was moved.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,880
 Knight F6. Trading pieces should be good when I'm up in materials. Something was moved. I'll take

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,320
 this bishop. I mean who knows, maybe there was nothing defending that bishop and I get to win

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:48,560
 another piece for free. Sadly it didn't happen. Knight C6. F5. We can easily see that this guy is

16
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:56,160
 very aggressive for pushing both his F pawn and his G pawn very far forward. Castle. Now we also

17
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,680
 see his E pawn. I don't want to risk taking that pawn when we don't know if he has a pawn defending

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:12,560
 it or not. F6. Something was moved. Now I'll take this pawn. Something was moved. Ah ha. Now comes

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,360
 the problem. Do I take this pawn? I mean his G pawn is over here, his E pawn is dead, so this

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,360
 F pawn is definitely not defended by a pawn, his light square bishop is also dead, and I haven't

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,200
 heard the sound effect of a castle yet, so I'm down to say that his rook is also not defending

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,200
 this pawn, therefore, I'll take it. You may say that there might be a knight somewhere defending

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:49,760
 it, but I don't buy it. H6. I'll pull my bishop. Ah ha. I cannot move my bishop, so now we know

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,760
 that he has a rook somewhere on the G file, pinning my bishop to my king. So I guess,

25
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,080
 rook F7. Alright, I'm blundering a bishop, but we can still hope that he'll take with his rook so

26
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:11,440
 that I can trade down even more pieces. Perfect. Rook takes pawn takes. Queen E8. Beginner's tip,

27
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,080
 don't take this pawn, instead use it as a shelter for your king. D5 queen F7 something moved queen

28
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:26,000
 G7 knight H5 queen F7 something moved, ah ha. His light square bishop is dead, his G pawn is dead,

29
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,560
 his king's side's rook is dead. YOLO. Amazing. And you know what, I'm so confident that I think he

30
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,600
 won't be attacking my queen anytime soon, therefore, I'll move my rook. Something moved.

31
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,880
 I'm almost out of time, so let's play a little bit more risky. Something moved. Knight back.

32
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,600
 Something moved. I think his king is still on the E file, but queen E5 is too risky as that

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:03,520
 square may be under control by his dark square bishop, so I guess, queen G6. Something moved.

34
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:11,040
 Queen E6. And that sound effect was a check. Something moved. Man, I really don't know how

35
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:19,280
 to make progress. D5. C takes D5. And I've just realized that there may be a horsey controlling

36
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:28,480
 that square, so I'm actually blundering a fork. Queen D7. And he didn't take it. My time is almost

37
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:36,400
 up, and I cannot see any ways to make any progress here. Therefore, I'll offer a draw. Knight B8.

38
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,520
 Draw declined. And before my time runs out, I guess I'll just end the video right here.

39
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:58,160
