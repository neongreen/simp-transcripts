00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 100 rated chess, but you've got a cold, every second move you sneeze and have to move a piece.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:13,680
 Not porn, at least 4 squares. 4 squares obviously sounds way too difficult, so let's change it to

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:21,120
 3. Not gonna lie, it still sounds pretty impossible. We get a 1 1 4 from the US.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:28,240
 D4. So in order to have a lot of squares to move my pieces around, we need to open the board.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,640
 A counter gambit. I really want to take his pawn, but since it is my second move.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:43,520
 A2, knight c6. Let's count. 1, 2, 3. Which is to say, that every knight move is absolutely

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:54,960
 following the rules. F3. I'll take this pawn. C3. A2, 3 square move, knight f6. I mean he can go cd4

8
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,760
 and these center pawns are gonna cause a ton of trouble for me, but I didn't really have any

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:14,400
 choices. Thank you. Now I can take this pawn. B takes. A2, bishop c5. 1, 2, 3. Knight e2.

10
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,360
 D5 should be the best move here, but since I don't want to take too many risks,

11
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:29,440
 d6. To be clear, I'm not a coward, I'm just trying to be careful. G4. A2, 3 square move again.

12
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,040
 Knight e5. I'm threatening knight d3 checkmate in 1, but since it is so obvious,

13
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:44,560
 I don't think there's much hope in achieving it. Wow! Knight d3, checkmate.

14
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,360
 And here I thought it was absolutely impossible. Mission accomplished, but since the video is

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,400
 still so short, I'll answer some of your comments instead. Get rid of the cringed outro. Dude,

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,720
 this entire channel is cringe. I bet you all my friends that in the first 3 moves, you must have

17
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,320
 played a few games to find someone able to defend the queen and bishop mate at the start. Smiley

18
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:17,440
 face. No, you lost the bet, I only played once, and in fact, the 100 rated people are actually

19
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,240
 good enough to defend the scholar's mate. Now even though you've lost the bet, taking all of

20
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,920
 your friends obviously sounds way too cruel, so let's just say that I'll only take the girls,

21
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:40,480
 you can keep the dudes. Quack. Video spoilers, your permabanned.

22
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:47,840
