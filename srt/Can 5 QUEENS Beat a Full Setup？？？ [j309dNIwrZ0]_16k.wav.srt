00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
 I'm better than my viewers number 28, the saved stalemate.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,600
 Note, this position was built on the stalemating-

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,560
 Oh no, we don't talk about that one.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,920
 Welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,600
 and the challenger this time is a guy called Farmer Tom.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,680
 Normally I would let my opponent has the side that is having the advantage,

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,840
 but since even Stockfish is having difficulties analyzing this position,

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,360
 I let him choose his own pieces, and he chose

9
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:33,600
 the white pieces. Knight c6. I'm sorry David,

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,480
 but a center pawn cannot live for long against a lot of women anyway.

11
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,760
 David is dead. Rook b8. Queen f3. Knight f6. I don't know what he's

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,440
 trying to do yet, but since the position is very complicated,

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,400
 it's better to just defend everything. King a2. Not very aggressive.

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,800
 Bb6. The plan is obviously knight b4 check with a discovered attack on the

15
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,560
 queen, but since he's 1500 rated, there's not

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,920
 much room for that to happen. Or he can just straight up blundering a

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,640
 queen and absolutely ignores the tactic. Bishop takes queen takes. e6.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,120
 Queen bd1. Knight d5. Defending this pawn, also opening up the way to develop

19
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:28,240
 this bishop. Queen g4. Bishop f6.

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,160
 Again, I don't know what he's doing, but defending can never be a bad decision.

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,600
 Queen takes d5. Ah ha, he is once again offering a trade of a queen for two

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,600
 minor pieces, and since it is profit for me, I'll take

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,160
 it. Queen takes f6. h5.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:55,120
 Queen g2. Rook h7. Defending a possible threat, also making room for king h8 in

25
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,160
 the future. Queen e7. There's no way I can keep that

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,120
 queen alive, therefore, h4. You know what they say,

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,040
 if you're losing a woman, at least try to get another one.

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,560
 Queen f8 rook f8. And in this very position,

29
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,960
 since we can clearly see that I'm about to lose, I did the thing that every toxic

30
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,360
 players do when they are losing. I offered a draw, and to everyone's

31
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,680
 surprise, he refused it. Nice try, smiley face.

32
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,520
 Queen h3. c5. Queen e7. Rook h5. The grandmasters always say that you

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,080
 should get your rooks active in a rooks endgame,

34
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,920
 but quite frankly, that is freaking impossible in this game.

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,000
 Queen a7 d4. This is so hopeless. Queen b6. Rook a8. King b3. d3. King c3.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,760
 Ah ha! I guess it is time for my last

37
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,920
 ditch effort. Rook g5. The plan is queen takes h4. Rook g2. King takes d3.

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,040
 Rook a3. Check. King c4. And then rook a4. Check. Winning a woman.

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,080
 Perfect. Here we go. Rook g2. I've just figured out that he

40
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,880
 actually has queen b5 that can defend rook a5 and threaten queen e8 backrang

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,720
 checkmate at the same time, but since that move is very hard to see

42
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,440
 as you have to move a queen only one square,

43
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,760
 big chance is that he won't be able to see it.

44
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,640
 Ha! I was about to resign if he really sees queen b5.

45
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:39,040
 But anyway, rook takes d8. Queen d8. King h7 is forced. Queen d3. Check.

46
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,720
 And in this very position, we finally agreed to a draw,

47
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,280
 since this position is obviously a draw, and even though a draw usually means I'm

48
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,040
 better than my viewers, this time even Stockfish couldn't analyze

49
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,920
 the starting position to say that who's better.

50
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,760
 Therefore, I'm better than my viewers, but this guy,

51
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:04,720
 and only this guy, is equal to me.

52
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:17,440
