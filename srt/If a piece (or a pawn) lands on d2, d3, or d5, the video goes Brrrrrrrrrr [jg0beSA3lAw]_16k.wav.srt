1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 If a piece or a pawn lands on d3, the video goes 3d.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Then, if a piece or a pawn lands on d2, the video goes 2d.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 Then, if a piece or a pawn lands on d5, the game changes to 5d chess with multiverse time travel.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 That last one sounds a bit too dank. But still, it's not like I'll let that happen.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Let's find an opponent.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We get a 157 from Spain.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 For those of you who are looking for those squares, this is d2.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 This is d3.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 And this is d5.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 If something lands on any of those squares, the video changes accordingly to the rules.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 And of course, there is already a pawn on d2. Which means the video needs to change to 2d.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 But as you can see, it's already in 2d.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 Therefore, nothing changes.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 And since the d2 and d3 squares are totally my control,

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 all I need to do, is to prevent my opponent from putting anything on d5.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Normally, e4 should be the best move, but since he may be a Scandinavian player,

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 e4 is too risky.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So I guess, c4.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Of course he can still play d5, but there's nothing more I can do.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 e5.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Aha! He obviously wants a reversed Sicilian.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 But no!

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 e5.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 I need to overprotect the d5 square.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 a6.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Very non-aggressive.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Knight c3.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Of course, more pressure on d5.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 b5.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Very aggressive.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Taking the b-pawn should be the best move.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 But of course, I need my c-pawn to defend the d5 square.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Therefore, b3.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 bxc4.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 bxc4.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 knight c6.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 It seems like he wants knight d4, which is totally fine,

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 because the rules didn't say anything about 4d chess.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Knight f3.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Knight d4.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 That blunders a pawn.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But I think it's better to leave his pawn under attack,

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 so that he'll play d6 to defend it,

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 and after he's played d6,

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 it's more unlikely that he's going to push that pawn again.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Therefore, bishop e2.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 I want him to take my bishop instead of my knight,

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 so that my knight can keep the pressure on his e-pawn.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Knight takes e2.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Exactly as I planned.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Queen takes.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Now he should play d6 to defend his pawn, right?

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Bishop b7.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 That blunders the e-pawn again,

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 but of course, let's give him one more chance.

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Castle.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Knight f6.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 He still doesn't see it.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 Bishop b2.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 I'm putting even more pressure on his e-pawn.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 c6.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Ah ha!

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 So he obviously wants to go d5,

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 which makes me change the game.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Therefore, I'll take his pawn.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Now since my knight is very close,

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 he'll definitely play d6 to attack it, right?

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 Rook g8.

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 That looks like a mouse slip.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 d4.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I'm trying to get him focus on my knight.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Okay, let's change game.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Yes!

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 I've just had to buy this game for $5.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 If this video doesn't make me more than $5,

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 I think I'm going to cry.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 But anyway, let's get in there.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 Guide.

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Nah.

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Who cares?

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 I can play chess.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Public match.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Let's go for short clocks.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Okay, I've been waiting for a while now,

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 and came to a conclusion,

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 that very few people are playing this game now.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 Therefore, let's just end the video instead.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Thank you for watching.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 See you next time.
