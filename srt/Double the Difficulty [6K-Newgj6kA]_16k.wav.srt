00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
 100 rated chess, but you're running low on fuel, you can only move 4 times, but you gain

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,360
 1 additional move for every point of material you capture.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,000
 Giving me 2 additional moves was way too many to use, and quite frankly, turning 2 to 1

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,920
 is still very easy.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,640
 We get a very angry guy from Iceland.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,040
 E4.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,560
 E5.

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,200
 Qh5.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,160
 Nc6.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,480
 Nothing wrong so far, except the fact that I only have 2 moves until the video ends.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,480
 Bc4.

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,720
 Alright, g6 is the most popular move right now, but that will make this video absolutely

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,840
 impossible as I cannot capture anything to raise the move limit.

14
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,800
 Therefore, Qf6 instead.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,040
 Qxf7 will be very convenient.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,680
 Sadly he's not a paid actor.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:00,680
 I have to raise the move limit right now, and the only option is, Qxf3.

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,000
 +3 baby.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Gxf3.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 G6.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,600
 It's fine, a real man doesn't need a woman in his life.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,680
 And my opponent agrees.

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,200
 That is very convenient.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,320
 Now since I have a lot of moves, I think we can already see an easy victory in this game.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,320
 F4.

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,720
 3 more moves.

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,640
 These challenges get really convenient sometimes.

28
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,840
 D3 knight back knight a3 bishop takes pawn takes d5 e d5 knight e5 rook g1 knight f6

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,080
 f5 that blunders a pawn bishop h6.

30
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,640
 He'll have to castle the other way, knight g4.

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,240
 Attacking the bishop and also preparing the knight for a free f-pawn.

32
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,040
 Bishop g7.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,600
 Very aggressive.

34
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,840
 Rook g8.

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,460
 Bishop b2.

36
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,680
 Strong castle.

37
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,880
 If I castle, he'll castle.

38
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,520
 Absolutely.

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,260
 That blunders a pawn.

40
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,840
 Rook d2.

41
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
 Knight h3.

42
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,240
 I feel like I'm wasting too many moves on this useless horsey.

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,720
 Rook g3.

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,240
 Rook e8.

45
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,240
 Only 6 moves left, guess I'll have to find a way to trade down a rook.

46
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
 Nevermind.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,040
 +5 baby.

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,020
 How about blundering the other rook too.

49
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:30,520
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor.

50
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
 Rook takes e2.

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,360
 c4.

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,600
 Knight e3.

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,600
 Checkmate incoming.

54
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,200
 Or not.

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,080
 Mission accomplished.

56
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:55,800
 Thanks for watching.
