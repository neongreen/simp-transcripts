00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
 It's Tuesday 21st of February 2023, aka the Fat Tuesday. So 100 rated chess, but your pieces are

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,200
 fat, they cannot move further than 2.25 squares per move, they cannot move twice in a row,

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,960
 the horses cannot jump, and the rooks cannot castle. Disallowing moving twice in a row is

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,080
 obviously just making this challenge impossible to navigate, so we have to delete this part.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,240
 And I'm not a coward. We get a 1 53 from the US. A 4. If you really think about it,

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,840
 if my bishops travel 2 squares, they are actually covering a distance of 2 times square root of 2,

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,400
 which is 2.8, longer than 2.25, which means my bishops can only travel 1 square each time in

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,080
 this game, which means they are absolutely useless, so there is no need to push the center pawns.

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,400
 D5. Rook K3. Moving in a straight line is the only way I can utilize this challenge to the utmost.

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:14,080
 C5. H4. G5. Very aggressive. Left blunders a pawn. H6. I want to move this rook to the king's side,

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:24,880
 therefore, rook C3. Well, I guess it'll take a while. H takes G5. Wait. That blunders a rook,

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,360
 but I cannot take it due to the rules, and I also cannot move my rook anywhere,

13
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,640
 because it will die regardless.

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,720
 It's fine, at least I can take back a bishop, and who knows, maybe he'll decide to be an unpaid

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:56,080
 actor and not take my rook. And he did. Rook G3. Ha! Thank you very much. Rook H1. Very aggressive.

16
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:04,000
 I'll take this pawn. My knights cannot move anyway. So f*** them. Rook takes useless horsey.

17
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:13,440
 E4. We'll use our queen. Rook takes F1. King takes. Ha! Now it's like a two pieces for a

18
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,920
 rook trade, which is definitely good for me because those pieces are trash for this game.

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:29,200
 Bishop H6. That blunders a horsey, but it is too far. Bishop G7. I can take it. F takes E4.

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,680
 Ah ha! That blunders a knight and a queen, but after I take his knight, there is a small chance

21
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,880
 that he'll go king F7, which actually trash my rook because his queen is too far away and my rook

22
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:48,000
 cannot be retreated to a safe square. So I guess, queen E2. It's fine, there's no need to rush.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,160
 Knight F6. Queen E3. And don't even tell me that I blundered a fork. I see that.

24
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,640
 And he sees it too. Queen G3. Since I've already broken down his kingside, it's better to just

25
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,000
 use two pieces to deliver a quick checkmate than to spend too many moves on unnecessary pieces.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,560
 D takes C3. Queen G5. We're slowly getting there. King F8. We can easily see,

27
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:30,640
 that he's getting scared. Queen G6. Threatening queen F7 mate. Queen E8. Queen H6. Threatening

28
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:38,960
 queen H8 knight G8 queen G8 checkmate in two. Knight G8. This guy is really defending all of

29
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:49,520
 my mating threats. Queen H7. Let's see how long he can survive. Well. Not very long. Queen H8

30
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:57,600
 knight G8 queen G8 checkmate. Mission accomplished.
