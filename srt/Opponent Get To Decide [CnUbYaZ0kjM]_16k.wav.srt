00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge after your opponent's third move.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,720
 This is the first time that I've had to reveal a challenge after my opponent does something.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,400
 So maybe it's actually easy. We get a 157 from India.

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:24,560
 E4. E5. Since the challenge is connected to my opponent's moves and not mine,

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,920
 the best plan is definitely to delay his development, and the most optimal way to do it,

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,040
 is a gambit.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:40,720
 Qh4 check. G3. This is also very good, because I can force him to retreat his queen right before

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,320
 the challenge begins, which means his development is absolute zero at the moment I opens that

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,960
 covered section. Qh6. Alright. Here we go.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,080
 What file did that piece come from? You must make only knight moves for the matching number of files,

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,280
 a is 1, b is 2, and so on. And h is 8.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:19,760
 Worst possible situation, but that's life. E takes f4. Knight c3.

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:31,040
 D6. This pawn cannot go down any further. Knight e2. Bishop h3. That attacks my bishop,

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,280
 but knight move is forced. I mean who knows, if he can just blunder his bishop right now,

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,880
 that will be very convenient. Well, not a paid actor.

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:54,480
 Long castle. Knight hg5. Triple fork looks absolutely amazing. Rook e8. Aha!

17
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,160
 Now he's threatening rook takes e4 check, and there's nothing I can do about it.

18
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:11,200
 Well you know what they say, if you cannot defend, you don't defend. Knight takes f7.

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,360
 Rook takes e4 makes me a fool for ending the video, but you better move your queen here.

20
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:26,800
 Still thinking.

21
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:38,320
 Mission accomplished.

22
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:48,760
