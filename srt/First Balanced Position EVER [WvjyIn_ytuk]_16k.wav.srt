00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 This guy made a position for I'm better than my viewers, but sadly, I'll use it for another video.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,920
 Welcome to another episode of my viewers cheat, and the cheater this time is a guy called rosy

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:19,120
 cheeked beard. The rules are very simple. He uses stockfish. I don't. I'll take this bishop first.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:23,840
 I'm giving him a choice, if he takes with king, I'll trade the other bishop as well,

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,760
 but if he takes with bishop, each of us gets to keep the bishop for ourselves.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,760
 Bishop takes. Knight f3. In case you're wondering, only you guys and my opponent get to see stockfish

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:45,840
 lines, I've already covered this section on my computer. Trust. Knight c6. Knight g4. Queen b8.

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,760
 Before starting the game, I asked my opponent to choose a number between 1 to 5, he picked 3,

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,320
 and since now is already 3 moves into the game. Stockfish disabled. No worries, I'll enable it

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,600
 again after 3 moves, but now is my chance to try and take a lead. Queen g1. The plan is very simple,

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,200
 both of us are trying to take control over the e5 square, so queen g1 queen c5 putting

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:19,040
 more pressure on e5 is definitely the best continuation. Knight b5. Queen c5. Please

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:29,360
 don't offer a queen trade. Thank you. That drops the e5 square. Bishop g8. 3 moves have passed,

14
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,160
 I'll enable stockfish again. Bishop takes g8. As you can see, stockfish didn't like that move

15
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,520
 very much because the best move was queen f2, but since I'm not cheating like my opponent,

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:50,080
 I couldn't see that. King takes queen c4 king h8 queen f7 queen c7. Wow. For some reason,

17
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,280
 stockfish actually allowed me to take this pawn, and even though I feel like this is a trap,

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,720
 since he doesn't have stockfish anymore at this point, I will take it. King h7. Let's make a

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,840
 sacrifice. G takes queen check king down queen check king up queen check king down queen takes

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,360
 queen takes knight check royal fork. King g7. Knight takes e7. And even though I'm being up 2

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,440
 pawns in this position, my opponent still refused to resign from the game, so we shuffled our pieces

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:29,120
 around for the next 25 moves. Queen d5. Checkmate. In case you want to ask why didn't I just fast

23
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,880
 forward the moves instead of skipping them, that was 25 moves in a row, which is 50 moves for both

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,920
 sides, and editing that will take an enormous amount of time, which I rather spend on watching

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,080
 pawns.

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:49,280
 so

27
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,280
 you

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,860
 (upbeat music)
