00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 100 rated chess, but you must win, by surrender or checkmate, without taking any of their pieces.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,520
 Or pawns. Sounds absolutely impossible, I mean some people literally even made the how word

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,160
 right here, but of course, I'm not a coward. We get a 2-0-3 from somewhere around the world,

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,360
 and I'm sorry I had to censor his profile image, because he uses a picture of his son.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,320
 Or his neighbor's son I don't know. G4. Very aggressive. D5. I mean I technically cannot

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,360
 take his pawn due to the rules, but since he doesn't know about that, maybe he'll get scared

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,680
 and waste a move to push that pawn again. Just as planned. E5. Again, I cannot take his pawn,

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,080
 but based on how he's been playing, H4 protecting the pawn should be expected.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,560
 I know this guy like the palm of my ex-girlfriend. Bishop C5. Since he already pushed his king's

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,520
 pawns, it is the most natural to just start a quick attack at his king. H5. That blunders the

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,480
 G pawn again, but I'll go for. H6. Deflecting this pawn away from controlling the F6 square.

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,400
 Exactly. Queen F6. H takes G7. Aha, that blunders a king in two different ways,

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,600
 but since both of those moves are breaking the rules of capturing a pawn, I actually cannot do

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:40,160
 that. Rook H6. It's fine, no need to rush. F3. Aha, that blunders a horsey to bishop takes G1,

15
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,240
 because rook takes is blundering queen H4 check rook G3 is force queen takes G3 checkmate in 2.

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:54,160
 But again, I cannot make any captures. The plan is very simple. F takes E4, and I can finally checkmate.

17
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:06,160
 That was very convenient. Bishop F2. Checkmate. Wow. And here I thought this challenge was

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:12,800
 totally impossible even for Magnum Carlos. But anyway. I'll answer some of your comments.

19
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,440
 Offering a draw when you could have still checkmated, and simps says he's no coward.

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,240
 Dot dot dot. So here is the controversial part. You see, before offering a draw, I'd already known

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,200
 there would be people saying that I'm a coward, who would also dislike the video, and the fact

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,800
 that I can accept my video being disliked by many people which hurts its view count. Prove that I'm

23
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,800
 not a coward. Question mark times 4 WTF was that simp, I'm an absolute t*t at chess, but even I saw

24
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,320
 that move being disastrous, just move the threatened knight elsewhere, question mark question mark

25
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:54,240
 question mark. So normally I don't tend to answer backseaters, because there are too many of them,

26
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,760
 but since this guy gave me 7 question marks, this was the position he was talking about,

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,320
 my move was queen to E4, and instead of queen E4, he wanted me to move one of these knights instead,

28
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:12,400
 while this bishop is pinned and this knight is pinned. So I guess, I absolutely agree with this

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,000
 part.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,760
 *Outro*
