00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 100 rated chess, but you had way too much caffeine, every 5 moves you go afk to have

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,740
 explosive diarrhea.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,080
 Let's say, 2 minutes.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,360
 You may be wondering why it takes me so fast to carry out such thing, let's just say I

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,920
 have some secret skills.

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,720
 We get a 1 0 5 from the Philippines.

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,720
 E4.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,200
 The plan is very simple.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,480
 If I have to afk 2 minutes every 5 moves, I technically only have 10 moves to finish

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,760
 this game.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,440
 Therefore, let's try to do it in 5.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,100
 E5.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,360
 Bishop C4.

14
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,520
 A light square bishop is definitely one of the strongest weapons against a black king.

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,520
 G6.

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,200
 Ah ha.

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,760
 What a coward.

18
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,800
 He's obviously trying to prevent queen H5, so if I play queen F3 right now, he will most

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,040
 likely be able to see the threat immediately and prevent it from happening.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,000
 So I guess, D4.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
 He takes D4.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,200
 I'll develop my queen this way.

23
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,320
 It's gonna be hard to think about a quick checkmate, but there is no problem to think

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
 about a quick free rook.

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,280
 Or bishop.

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
 Queen takes G7.

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
 Knight E7.

28
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
 Ah ha.

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,360
 That blunder's a king, but according to the mission, I have to go afk after 5 moves, and

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,920
 now since 5 moves have passed, I'll answer some of your comments during the free time.

31
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,280
 I obviously definitely really don't like ads, but I love your videos, heart heart heart.

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,880
 But I like ads, so I don't like you.

33
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,080
 Can't comprehend the incomprehensible.

34
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,280
 I'm not a chat.

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,660
 Coward.

36
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,200
 You would want to be white to actually win this challenge.

37
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,720
 This challenge said that I needed to impress my Asian parents, and if you think I can do

38
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,720
 that just by switching sides, I can easily tell that you're not an Asian and don't have

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,920
 any Asian friends.

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,440
 Resignation.

41
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,160
 Mission.

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,640
 Accomplished.

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:20,440
