1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
 100 rated chess, but you can't move a piece, not pawn, until its brother is dead.

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,560
 Very challenging.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,880
 We get a 2 47 from the US.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,000
 D4.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,720
 So I believe the only way to do this challenge, is to sacrifice pieces on one side, and then

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,040
 try to use the pieces in the other side.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,440
 Therefore, C5. I'll get this pawn all the way down to my horsey right here.

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,560
 And of course, since I only have 1 king and 1 queen, I cannot move them through the entire

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,880
 game.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,040
 D takes C5.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,560
 B6.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,120
 C takes B6.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,680
 Ok, let's think about this carefully.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,640
 After B takes A7 and A takes B8, he'll make a queen, but I cannot take his new woman,

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,320
 because both of my rooks are still alive.

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,120
 Therefore, H5.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,920
 I want to go H4, then after his new queen takes my rook, I can safely develop my other

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,520
 rook to H5.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,840
 B takes A7.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,640
 H4.

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,000
 A pawn changed gender.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,640
 And since my B knight is dead, knight F6.

23
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,480
 Man, this challenge actually reminds me of Spider-Man, because he only lives seriously,

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,080
 after his uncle Ben is already dead.

25
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,320
 Queen takes A8.

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,880
 Exactly as planned.

27
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,280
 Rook H5.

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,560
 Ok.

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,880
 Now the game truly begins.

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,620
 I'm being down 19 points of material, and if we include my queen as well, it's actually

31
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,120
 plus 28 for my opponent.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,520
 Very, challenging.

33
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,680
 Wait what?

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,860
 That blunders a queen.

35
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,500
 But I cannot take that queen, due to the mission's rule.

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,660
 And after queen takes D8, the mission's failed, since I can't move my king either.

37
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,960
 What the f*** am I supposed to do then?

38
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,880
 E5.

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,680
 Now please get tunneled vision and focus in the center.

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,200
 My god that is scary.

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,680
 But anyway, that forces me to take a queen.

42
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,640
 Knight takes D7.

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:38,040
 Even though I've won a queen, the situation is actually not much better than before.

44
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:52,000
 I hate this guy.
