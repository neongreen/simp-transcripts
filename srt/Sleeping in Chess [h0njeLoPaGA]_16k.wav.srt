1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 100 rated chess, but everyone lacks sleep, whenever a piece, or pawn, moves, it cannot

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,840
 move for 1 turn because it is napping.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,320
 Absolutely impossible, we get a 1 78 from the US.

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,320
 E4.

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,600
 Knight F6.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,640
 I really want to push this pawn to attack his knight, but that will make me a fool for

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,840
 ending my own video, I also cannot let his knight move again because that will also end

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,840
 the video.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,840
 Therefore, knight C3.

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:36,120
 No safe move for his knight, except this one.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,120
 Of course it doesn't happen.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,400
 Now normally this is a great chance to go for the Vienna gambit, but if he accepts the

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,400
 gambit, that will make his E pawn breaks the rules by moving 2 times in a row, which makes

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,900
 me a fool for literally provoking him to end my video.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,040
 So I guess.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,600
 Bishop C4.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,840
 D5.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,880
 Aha, if I let that pawn live, it will most likely move again, therefore.

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,560
 Die.

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
 Knight H8.

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,080
 That blunders a horsey, and again, cannot let that horsey move.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:16,520
 Well, I mean if he can also blunder his queen next, that will be very convenient.

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,820
 I solemnly swear, that no one on my channel is a paid actor, including this guy.

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,960
 But anyway.

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,520
 I'll take that woman.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,280
 I mean if he plays C6 right now, I won't be able to move my knight away due to the rules,

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,680
 and I also have just realized that I have no way to stop his pawn from taking my knight

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,440
 next, which also ends the video because his C pawn will be making 2 moves in a row.

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,200
 Wow.

30
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:53,580
 Now what the f*** am I supposed to do?

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,580
 Wait what?

32
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,580
 Ha.

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,580
 Draw accepted.

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:02,360
 Mission f***ing accomplished, and feel free to say that this guy is a paid actor because

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,700
 even I don't believe that he's not one, but since the video is still so short, I'll answer

36
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,120
 some of your comments.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,100
 How does he get the account to 100 elo each time?

38
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,160
 Magic.

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,740
 Just move the queen to the corners and you can use the center.

40
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,740
 That is a very nice way to say that a woman is fat.

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,460
 This man is not 1200 plus.

42
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,660
 Ah ha.

43
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,840
 You must be new to the channel, in case you don't know, I'm actually just a 100 rated

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,300
 chess player, which means I'm sitting at the very bottom of the rating ladder.

45
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,640
 But guess what?

46
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:44,340
 I'm better than my viewers.

47
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:54,240
