00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 I'm good at drawing from worse positions, this guy is so permabanned. I'm better than my viewers.

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,960
 Nice. Let's go. Welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,320
 and the challenger this time is a guy called seal and ball, or maybe it's seal and ball.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:26,400
 I'll take this bishop. King e7. Knight takes d4. Maybe rook takes b4 was better,

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,000
 but taking this way is opening up the chance that he may go knight d4 allowing queen d4 attacking

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,080
 his king. Sadly he's not a paid actor. Knight takes f5 check. Opening up the way for my queen

7
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:49,840
 to advance forward. Knight takes f5. Okay. Here we go. Queen c7 check. Apparently stopfish didn't

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,280
 like that move at all, but the idea is that if he can go king e6 blundering a king to knight f4

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:02,960
 checkmate in one, that will be very convenient. Of course that doesn't happen. Rook takes g4.

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:11,760
 Queen f6. Ah ha, that blunders a knight to queen d7 king d7 queen f6, and even though I normally

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,160
 wouldn't do that because I don't have many materials left for a possible checkmate at his

12
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:25,840
 king, I can't risk my viewers calling me coward. King takes d7. Queen takes f6. Knight takes d3.

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:34,720
 That blunders a fork, queen takes g6, forking his knight and rook. Knight e5. Ah ha, after I said

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,560
 that he was blundering a fork, he's like no, you are blundering a fork, not me. Queen h5 knight g4

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:51,280
 queen f5 bishop e6 queen h7 knight e7. Knight e4. Alright, now I need to be careful, because in case

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,880
 you don't know, I actually don't know how to checkmate with two knights, so my queen is basically

17
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:06,320
 all I have left to win this game. Bishop f5. Knight c5 check. King c6 blundering a horsey will be very

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,560
 convenient. Nevermind. Knight e4 check. I mean since I cannot checkmate with horses, trading

19
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:24,560
 them off is totally fine. King d7. Ah ha. I can see what he is trying to do here. Knight c5 king d6

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:34,320
 knight e4 what the f*** was that? Dude. I thought he wanted a draw. Okay fine. Knight f6 queen b4

21
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:43,120
 king e6 knight f4 king f7 coward queen b3 knight d5 knight d5 rook d6 queen b5. Rook d5 is obviously

22
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,720
 a draw, but then once again, he forces me to continue playing. And then he said, hey who knows,

23
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:58,080
 maybe you'll blunder your queen. Yeah. Sure. And then we shuffle our pieces around for the next 10

24
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,360
 moves without anything happening. A lot of people got mad every time I skipped the moves in my

25
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:12,560
 previous videos, but please, there was absolutely nothing to see. King b4. Alright, now king d5 is

26
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,240
 blundering a skewer through all of his pieces on the board, but then suddenly, he offered a draw.

27
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:25,920
 And I declined. Ha. The guy who thought that I would be blundering my queen, blundered both of

28
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:34,160
 his pieces in a single move. Queen f5 king d4 queen c5 king e4 queen b5. And then I asked,

29
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:42,240
 do you resign? HMM, no. This guy seriously thinks that I'm gonna stalemate him with my queen.

30
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,000
 Okay chess lesson for the beginners, it is actually very simple, you just try to put your

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,040
 queen in an L-shaped position like this against the enemy king, just like how a knight moves,

32
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,080
 and then no matter what he does, you just copy his king's move. King goes diagonal, you go diagonal,

33
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,600
 king goes down, you go down, until the king reaches the edge of the board, you move the queen

34
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,280
 in a way that she traps the king on a single line, and then move closer until the king only has 2

35
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,280
 squares to move, or in another word, put your queen in one of these squares, and do not move

36
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,520
 her closer, now move your king closer until he can control this square, and then move your queen to

37
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,400
 that square. Checkmate. And then he said, stockfish screaming at you telling this is not the fastest

38
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:48,320
 to checkmate using king and queen. Well, I'm better than my viewers.
