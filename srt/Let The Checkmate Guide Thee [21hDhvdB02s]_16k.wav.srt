1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 100 rated chess, but if you can blundermate in one, you have to.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,520
 That sounds a little bit too easy, so let's change it to "Any checkmates?" and I have

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,480
 to play the Hyperbong Cloud opening.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,080
 Yeah, now that sounds a little bit more challenging.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,480
 We get a 3 0 7 American.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,480
 E4.

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,800
 E5 is obviously the most popular response to E4, but if I play E5, there is a chance

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,080
 that he's gonna play Qh5, and since the challenge requires me to blunder my king at any time

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:44,080
 possible, I will have to play Ke7, which blunders queen takes E5 checkmate in one.

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,400
 Therefore, E6.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,200
 I mean I normally don't like the French defense, but since I'll have to play the Hyperbong

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,320
 Cloud, this move is actually kinda forced.

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,320
 Bishop C4.

14
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,720
 Alright.

15
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,320
 Here we go.

16
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,040
 King E7 is forced.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,440
 Queen F3.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,560
 I can already see, that this is not going to go well for me.

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,920
 King D6 is forced, and to make it even more challenging, I will not retreat my king, which

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,960
 means I will try my best to keep him on the 6th rank, or even further beyond.

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,040
 E5 check.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,680
 Wow.

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,880
 How the hell did he find that move?

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,080
 Taking that pawn is blundering a checkmate in 6.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,720
 But as the challenge requires, I have to do it.

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,800
 For those of you guys watching, feel free to pause the video right now to find the checkmate

27
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:50,440
 in 6 for white, but I definitely don't think that my opponent is gonna cd4 check king D6

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:57,880
 queen A3 check king C6 queen A4 check king D6 queen B4 check king C6 queen B5 check king

29
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,120
 D6 queen C5 mate.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,360
 Of course.

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,560
 I'll go this way.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,400
 A4.

33
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
 Very aggressive.

34
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,720
 Knight C6.

35
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,640
 Well I mean if he can just blunder his queen right now, that would be very convenient.

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,920
 Of course it doesn't happen.

37
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,580
 I still get a rook though.

38
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,520
 B takes A3.

39
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
 Knight H6.

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
 H4.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
 Oh.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,000
 I actually didn't even see that.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,520
 Now queen G5 is checkmate in 1, and as the rule suggests, I must not defend myself from

44
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,560
 it.

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,560
 So I guess.

46
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
 D5.

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,560
 Hey man, I'm attacking your bishop, so you won't checkmate me.

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
 Right?

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
 Ha!

50
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,840
 Noob.

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,760
 But now what do I do?

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,560
 I mean attacking his queen is pretty much telling his queen to checkmate me.

53
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
 Alright.

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,360
 I guess we have no choice.

55
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,360
 Knight D4.

56
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,360
 Hey man, I'm blundering my horse here, so of course you won't checkmate me.

57
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,360
 Right?

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,360
 Of course.

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,040
 That's a weird move.

60
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,600
 Knight F5.

61
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,600
 Well I mean since he's already missed it twice, I think it's time to take a risk and force

62
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,200
 his queen to move away.

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,560
 Queen E2.

64
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,560
 That blunders- Oh.

65
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:44,760
 Knight F5 actually left a spot for my king to run if queen G5 happens.

66
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,560
 Did I just f***ing end my own video?

67
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:49,920
 What the f-

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:04:04,520
 [outro]
