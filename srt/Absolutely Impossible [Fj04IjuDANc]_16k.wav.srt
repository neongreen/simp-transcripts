00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 100 rated chess, but you're nothing like your opponent, you have to move a different type of

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,120
 piece than they did, from a different color square, and also to a different color square.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,640
 Okay this sounds absolutely impossible, so let's just delete this part away.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,720
 And to be honest, this still sounds very impossible. We get a 188 from Italy.

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,480
 H3. Ah ha, that pawn moved from a dark square to a light square, so I need to make a move from a

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:38,160
 light square to a dark square. B6. Fianchetto. Being a bishop doesn't sound so bad. Knight C3.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,440
 Light to dark, so I need to go. Dark to light. Man, I guess it'll take a while until he makes

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:54,400
 a dark to dark move so that I can move my bishop. Nevermind. Bishop B7. A3. Light to dark,

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,440
 dark to light, this guy has to be the most not very aggressive opponent I have ever met.

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:07,280
 G4. Very aggressive. That blunders a rook, but since he made a light to light move, I cannot

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,800
 move my light square bishop due to the rules, and since I obviously want him to make a dark to dark

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,840
 move, let's go for. Bishop takes A3. This will guarantee that he'll make a dark to dark move,

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,080
 which allows me to take his rook. Well, I mean that isn't the move in the plan,

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,840
 but since it's still a dark to dark move, I can take his rook. I mean now if he can make a light

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,240
 to light move to let me retreat my bishop, that will be very convenient. Of course it doesn't

16
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:46,160
 happen. F5. I want to go queen H4, so F5 is to provoke G takes, and there is no way that is not

17
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:56,800
 happening. Ha! Again, that is also a light to light move, which is totally acceptable. King D1.

18
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,320
 That was a dark to light move, so even though I think that horses are absolutely useless in this

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,360
 game, I don't really have many choices. Now just take this pawn and we'll both be happy. Or I mean

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,800
 at least I'll be happy. Queen F3. Dude! That blunders a queen, but I cannot take it because

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,080
 I have to make a dark to dark move, and there is absolutely no dark to dark move that can defend

22
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:31,200
 my rook and my bishop. C5. Alright, let's just hope that he'll take this pawn. It's a dark to

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,880
 dark move again, and still there is no way I can defend my rook, and then he'll clean my entire

24
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:45,200
 back rank. Queen F2. Ha! You better get scared of this move. This guy is totally destroying me.

25
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,160
 And I can't even take his bishop for a check, because I have to make a dark to dark move,

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,320
 then he can take my knight for a check, and since that'll be a light to dark move,

27
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,440
 I won't be able to move my king because the king is on a light square, which means I'll have to

28
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,800
 end the video. Please move your queen back to defend your bishop.

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:25,600
 Yeah there's no way this is possible.

30
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,340
 (dramatic music)
