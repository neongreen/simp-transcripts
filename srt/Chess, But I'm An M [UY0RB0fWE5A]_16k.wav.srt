1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 If none of my pieces and pawns are attacked, the video ends.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Let's go. We get a 137 from Mexico.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Of course none of my pieces and pawns are attacked on my first move,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 so in order for it to be fair, let's delay the challenge to move to

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 E4, E5. Ok, now the challenge starts.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 D4. Of course I need to give him something to attack.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 E takes D4. C3. D takes.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 So if I just continue with theory and play Bishop C4, after C takes B2,

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Bishop takes will end the video, since none of my pieces are attacked anymore at that point.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Therefore, H4. With this pawn push, even after I take this pawn out,

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 he will still have his queen attacking my H-pawn.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 C takes B2. Bishop takes. Ok. Now comes the moment of truth.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 If he plays Knight F6, then even though it blocks his queen from seeing my H-pawn,

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 his knight will then attack my E-pawn, but if he plays Knight E7, or even better, King D7,

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 the video ends.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Knight F6. Thank you. Let's gambit another pawn. Bishop C4.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Knight takes E4. Yes. Not only he opened up the way for his queen to attack my H-pawn,

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 but his knight also has a new target is my F-pawn.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Queen D5. Now please don't see anything and lose.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And in no world do you play Knight G5 now.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Why is he thinking for so long?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Bishop before check. King F1 is kinda forced.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 Queen takes H4. That blunders a queen. But should I even take it, though?

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Because after I take his queen, my rook will be attacking his knight, which may cause his knight to move,

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 and a move like Knight G5 or Knight C5 will end the video.

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Well, I guess I can just check his king first. Queen takes F7, check.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 King D8 is forced. Again, do I take his queen?

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 I mean now if I take his queen, my rook will still attack his knight like before,

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 but he can choose to play rook F8, which counterattacks my queen.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Nah. I think that's still too risky. Bishop takes G7. Oh no my rook.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Queen takes H1. That blunders a king. Wow! I can't believe a woman can just leave her husband to death,

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 and go inside another man's house like that. Bishop F6 check.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Knight takes F6. Queen takes F6 check.

35
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Bishop E7. That blunders the king even faster.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 By the way, for those of you guys who can't see it, instead for bishop block, if he went king E8,

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I would have had bishop F7 check, king F8 is forced, bishop G6 check, king G8 is forced, queen F7 checkmate.

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 But anyway, in this situation, it's much easier. Queen takes H8 check.

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Bishop F8 is forced. Queen takes F8 checkmate.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Mission accomplished.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:15,000
