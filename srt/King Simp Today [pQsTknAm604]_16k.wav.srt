00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but every time your opponent moves their queen, you'll move your king closer

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:16,080
 to their queen. That sounds absolutely terrifying. We get a 197 from turkey. E4. Ah ha, that move

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,920
 opens up his queen's way, so I also need to open up my king, or else if he moves his queen,

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,640
 I'll have to end the video. So I guess, E6, I mean E5 was obviously blundering a king because

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,680
 after queen H5, king E7 is force and then there is queen takes E5 checkmate in 1. And to be honest,

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:44,320
 I'm not very interested in such checkmate. Bishop C4. Oh no. We all know that his queen is coming

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,680
 next, and according to the mission, that cannot be a good sign for my video. Therefore, D5. If I

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:01,920
 attack his bishop, he cannot move his queen. Right? No doubt. D takes E4. Ha, now my pawn also

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,520
 removes the F3 square away from his queen, which makes the chance of him moving his queen right now

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:16,320
 much smaller than before. Nevermind. Alright. Here we go. King E7, oh wait maybe I should've gone

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:26,080
 king D7 because queen E4 king E7. Yeah. I really should've gone king D7. But anyway, king D6,

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:34,480
 okay now queen F4, queen E3, queen D4, queen C4, or even queen D5 is immediately ending the video

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,920
 because I cannot move my king closer to his queen at any of those squares. And to be honest,

14
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,240
 a situation where my opponent has 5 different ways to end the video, is probably not very ideal for

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,840
 a video's length. Ha, what do you do when your opponent put their king in the middle of the board?

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,480
 You move your H pawn of course. King E7, I mean the challenge only said that I have to move my

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,920
 king if my opponent moves his queen, but didn't say that I cannot move my king if the queen doesn't

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:13,520
 move, so this move is obviously legal to make. Queen B4 check. King E8 will be a dream come true,

19
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:22,720
 but sadly, I have to go closer. Queen C3. King D6 is forced, man, now once again there are 5 moves

20
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,760
 to end the video. And that was very convenient. King E7, somehow I actually have faith that my

21
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,880
 king will finally be at his home someday in the future. And that future came. King E8,

22
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,920
 if he can just not move his queen for like the next 3 moves, that will help me a lot.

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:53,680
 Bishop E3. Knight C6, let's try our luck at winning his queen. Bishop A4. Bishop D7. Knight A3.

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,920
 Ah ha. You know what they say, knight on the rim, dims the queen. Bishop B4 royals cure,

25
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,920
 that is a very risky move, but if I can win his queen, the video is 100% a success,

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,200
 and even though now he can actually go queen takes B4 ending the video because I cannot move

27
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,880
 my king closer to his queen on B4, I actually have faith that he will take my knight instead

28
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,920
 because he is good enough to use his bishop to pin my knight, so now is the moment to finally

29
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:33,200
 activate that entire power of that bishop pinning move. Yeah maybe I shouldn't have done that.

30
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:48,160
