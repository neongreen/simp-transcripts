00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 100 rated chess, but you must checkmate your opponent's king while all four corners of the board are occupied by your pieces.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Ha ha, can't add or pawns.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Very funny. We get a 250 from Saudi Arabia.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 E4. E5.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,500
 This challenge sounds absolutely terrifying because not only do I have to avoid a resignation,

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:32,500
 but I also need to keep a lot of materials alive because I already have to keep 4 pieces in 4 corners,

7
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,000
 the remaining pieces have to be enough to deliver a checkmate,

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,500
 which is to say, that you shouldn't be expecting too much from this video.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,000
 Knight F3 Knight F6 Bishop E5 I'll take this pawn D3 Knight D6.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Knight takes E5. That blunders a bishop, but do I even take it though,

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 because if I take it, my opponent may decides to resign oh well who cares anyway.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 As always, I'm not a coward.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Bishop E3. Queen F6. I mean as long as he doesn't blunder anything too crazy,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
 I won't take too much to cause a resignation.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,000
 Nevermind. I obviously cannot lose my rook because that is one of the corner pieces.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Therefore, king takes F7. Taking with the king will give him some reasons to continue playing this game instead of resigning from it.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Knight C3. That blunders a pawn. Knight takes pawn takes queen takes,

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,500
 I technically don't want to put my queen in the corner because I need her for the checkmate,

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,000
 so you better block with your bishop here.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Bishop blocks. I'll go back.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,500
 Castle. B6. The idea is that I want bishop B7 aiming for the corner,

22
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:54,000
 and I've just realized, that it actually blunders queen H5 G6 queen D5 losing this corner instead.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Ha! Doesn't matter. Bishop B7.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,500
 Rook F E1. Very aggressive.

25
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,500
 Bishop C5. Bishop C3. That blunders a bishop.

26
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 I mean as long as he doesn't blunder his queen, I'm pretty sure that he won't resign the game that easily.

27
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:20,500
 Are you serious? That blunders a woman, but of course, I cannot take it.

28
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,000
 I mean a move like queen G7 is basically forcing me to take his queen or lose this challenge.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,500
 But who plays like that anyway? Right?

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:38,000
 Of course, that still blunders the queen, but I really don't like to advance my king anymore because it is too risky.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,500
 So I guess, I don't have a choice.

32
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:47,000
 Rook takes king F7 Rook E1. Bishop A3. Marching the bishop to the corner.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,500
 Rook E7 check. That blunders a rook, but of course I cannot take it.

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,500
 Rook 1 E6 check. King F5.

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,500
 Rook F7 check. You know what? I'm sick of this.

36
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,500
 King takes E6. If he only has 1 rook, he won't think about checking anymore.

37
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,500
 Rook takes G7. I'm not even gonna mention about that blunder.

38
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,500
 Bishop B2. Alright, one more move and we'll only have one more corner to solve.

39
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:26,500
 Yeah there's no way this challenge is doable.

40
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:39,500
