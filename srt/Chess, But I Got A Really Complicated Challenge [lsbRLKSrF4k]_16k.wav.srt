 100 rated chess, but you don't check until your opponent has castled, and you don't checkmate until all of their pieces are captured.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Okay that is very confusing. Let me read that once again.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Ah, okay. I understand now. In short, this guy just wants me to have a long video.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Ha! That's all good for me. We get a 1 1 2 from the US.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Man I really need to learn all of these fancy openings.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Okay so according to the challenge, my opponent is supposed to castle his king as soon as possible, but at this rate, it doesn't seem like he wants to castle kingside.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 But anyway, that blunders a pawn.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Oh, wait. I think I have a great idea.

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Bishop e2. And would you look at that. Bishop e2, is brilliant.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Now he should be able to see, that taking my bishop is blundering. Bishop takes h5, rook takes h5 is forced, queen takes h5 checkmate, and even though technically I am not allowed to do that according to the challenge.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 But you know, that move looks cool.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Yeah he saw the trap. Now taking the pawn should be the best move, but once again, the challenge prevents me from doing that.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Therefore, I'll pull my bishop back.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Bishop h6. Hell yeah I'll take it, because after he takes with knight, his king will be readied for castling.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Except if he takes with rook and absolutely destroys his castling rights.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Alright. It's fine. Knight f3. At least he still has one way to castle, and if he sees I developed my piece, he'll want to develop his pieces. Right?

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Maybe not. I'll take that pawn.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Okay now you have to develop a piece.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Well that is also a piece, but I would love to see you develop the other side too.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Castle.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 And for some reason he decided to pull his rook back.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Knight e5. Now please push d6 to open up your bishop, or just develop your knight for a knight trade.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Okay, that also works. Knight c3.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Oh no please stop moving your rook. Look at this, that rook went from h8, to h6, then back to h8, now slides to g8.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Bishop f3. I'm just making random moves right now, since I can't attack him when his king hasn't castled yet, and I'm down more than 1 minute, just for being confused.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Rook g7.

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I don't even know what's happening anymore.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Knight e2. I mean I'm just making random moves now, since developing the queen or the rooks is meaningless, until I'm allowed to attack his king.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Ha! I guess that's better, since I don't have to suffer anymore.

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 But anyway.

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 What the f-

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:50,000
