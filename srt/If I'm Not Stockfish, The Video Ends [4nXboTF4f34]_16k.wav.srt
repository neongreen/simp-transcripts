1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 If I can't tell whether a move is a book move, best move, excellent move, or so on,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 the video ends.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 You know what? I'll give myself 2 options.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Which means, I can pick 2 answers on each move, and whichever guess is right, then it is right.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 This is going to be short.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I'll be honest, not even Magnus Carlsen can last over move 10 if he plays against a 100 rated.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 But anyway, let's find an opponent.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 We get a 286 from Canada.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Well, I think starting the game should not be too hard. Unless he plays... the Carders opening.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Yes. Not the Carders opening.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 E4 is definitely a book move, and I'm sure we don't need to check Stockfish about it.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 E5. E5 is also 100% a book move, and I also don't really want to check Stockfish,

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 because it will be a big humiliation, if I fail to analyze my own moves.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Knight f3. That is still in the book. And once again, we don't need to check that.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 But now, how should I continue?

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 I mean knight c6 will lead to some heavy theoretical lines, which I don't think my opponent knows,

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 because I also don't know.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 Therefore, knight f6. This is also a book move.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 In case you don't know, I'm actually a big fan of Eric Rosen, and I have also studied his Stafford Gambit lines.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 For anyone who don't know about the Stafford Gambit, it's a very forcing opening,

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 and that should help me a lot in analyzing the moves.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Bishop c4. Well, he didn't take the pawn, so my plan is ruined.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 But anyway. That is once again, a book move. And since this is the case, let's go for,

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 knight c6. I'm getting him into the fried liver, which also should be good, because it is also a very forcing line.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Once again, that was also a book move, and we also don't need stockfish.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Oh, kay. That is definitely, not a book move.

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And since it blunders a bishop, I will have my guess, as a blunder.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 But of course, I gave myself 2 guesses, so I need to maximize my chances.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Let's see. Even though he blundered his bishop, he still won the pawn, and make me unable to castle.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Therefore, my second guess will be, a mistake.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Okay. Stockfish?

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Yes. King takes f7. That is a best move.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 And you know what? I don't even need 2 chances now.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Stockfish.

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Ah. That feels good.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Oh. Kay. That once again, blunders a piece.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 But since he also won the pawn back, I think I will do it like last time.

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 It is either, a blunder, or a mistake.

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Stockfish?

41
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Yes.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And I will have my guess, as a blunder.

43
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 What the f-

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:32,000
