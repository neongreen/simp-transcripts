1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 100 rated chess, but the center is the fountain of youth, any pieces, or pawns, that land

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 in it become immortal.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,960
 Too easy, we get a 173 from Canada, so the obvious plan is to not put anything in the

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,360
 center, and also prevent my opponent from putting anything there.

5
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,120
 Therefore, knight f3, I mean at least this prevents e5, but if he plays d5 right now,

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,200
 that will be very bad.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,200
 b3.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,160
 Well, at the end of the day, that is just one pawn, and there is no way this video can

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,440
 be destroyed by just one pawn.

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,000
 Knight c6.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,680
 Bishop b2.

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
 f5.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,680
 Ha!

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,680
 Wrong pawn.

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,960
 e3.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,240
 As long as I can stop him from playing e5, things are going to be ok.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,560
 Nevermind.

18
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
 Bishop b5.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,880
 Alright, now both of his center pawns are immortal, but still they are only useless

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,000
 pawns, and there is no way I'm losing to those.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,440
 Bishop d7.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,480
 Queen e2.

23
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,040
 You may ask why did I play a useless move like queen e2?

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,840
 Guess what, I actually didn't know what to do at this point, so I just wanted to play

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,880
 a random move and then see what is going to happen next.

26
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,360
 a6.

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,560
 Capture is forced.

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
 Bishop takes.

29
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,960
 Since I cannot play in the center, let's try to make some progress on the edges of the

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,960
 board.

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,520
 h4.

32
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,640
 And you know what Stockfish said?

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,180
 h4 is a mistake.

34
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,080
 Knight takes e5 is best.

35
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,680
 Yeah f*** you Stockfish.

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
 h5.

37
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,780
 Ah ha!

38
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,920
 Knight g5.

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,720
 I mean if he can play e4 now to open my bishop and then move his bishop away so that I can

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
 trap his rook.

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,200
 That will be very convenient.

42
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,160
 No, that was only one move, he hasn't moved his bishop yet.

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,580
 Rook h3.

44
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,320
 No way that bishop is gonna move.

45
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,240
 Well, I guess sometimes things just naturally become very convenient in our lives.

46
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,320
 Bishop takes g7.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,640
 Rook h6.

48
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,500
 To be honest I'm actually very impressed that he found rook h6 to allow a recapture after

49
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,280
 my bishop takes his rook.

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,720
 It is not an easy thing to spot for a low-rated player.

51
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
 I'll take it.

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,360
 Knight takes, queen h5 check.

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,080
 King f8 queen h6 king e7 queen e6 and we can pre-move queen f7.

54
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,480
 Checkmate.

55
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,120
 And since this challenge was actually a bit too easy, there is no mission accomplished

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,640
 today.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:54,560
