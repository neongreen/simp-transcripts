1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 100 rated chess, but you keep your king in the center.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,640
 Smiley face.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,280
 OK, but we need to define again, where is the so called, center.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,060
 So for most people, the center is the center, 4 squares.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,680
 But in real game, after things like e4 e5, my king cannot get to that 4 squares, without

6
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,200
 going all the way around like this.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,640
 Therefore, I will define the center for this game, is this area.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,880
 I need to keep my king, here.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,000
 Let's go.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,680
 We get a 2 51 from Australia, with premiumed membership.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,400
 And it's very unfortunate, that we got the black pieces, which means there is a chance

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,840
 that I can't even get my king into the middle of the board.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,960
 e4 e5

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,140
 bishop c4 OK here we go again.

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,840
 King e7

16
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,000
 Queen g4 Ha, he moved his queen out as soon as I took

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
 my king into battle.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,880
 Which can be considered, as very aggressive.

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,380
 King d6 Man it feels like this guy knows what I'm

20
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,880
 trying to do, since he decided to control the e6 square, with 2 pieces, to guarantee

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,000
 that my king can never go to that square.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,320
 Knight c3 Knight f6

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,520
 Queen f5 g6

24
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,320
 Knight b5 check.

25
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,880
 Ah ha!

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
 Danger!

27
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880
 Levels!

28
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,520
 I attack his queen, he attacks my king.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,520
 King c5

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,760
 Queen take c5 check.

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,720
 That blunders a bishop.

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,000
 Except that it's not really a blunder of a bishop, but it's actually me blundering my

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400
 king.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,080
 So guys, feel free to pause the video right now and find the checkmate in 2 for white,

35
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,480
 while I don't give you any seconds to do so, since people will skip the video, so for those

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,320
 of you guys who were able to do it, congratulations, and for those of you who are here just to

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,820
 enjoy the show, which means you didn't see it.

38
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:23,160
 That's fine, because I didn't see it either, I mean I only got 3 minutes on the clock anyway.

39
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,340
 It was a4 and queen f3, or a4 knight e4 and queen d4.

40
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,340
 But anyway.

41
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,620
 Knight c3.

42
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,040
 Of course my opponent didn't see it either, and now queen b5 is very dangerous.

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,800
 c6.

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,720
 Except that that move once again blunder checkmate in 2, f*** my life, pause the video, or not

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,840
 it, and the move was b3, king b4, and a3, checkmate with a pawn.

46
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,480
 That was almost the biggest humiliation ever for me.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,700
 But instead, queen g3.

48
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,080
 Since he's moved his queen back.

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,780
 King c5.

50
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,520
 Knight a4 check.

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,840
 And funny enough, now king c4 and king d4 are my 2 only moves, which blunders checkmate

52
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,060
 in 5, or checkmate in 3.

53
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,980
 So of course, I chose, the checkmate in 3.

54
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,960
 I mean I didn't see any of those anyway, so it's not my fault.

55
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,720
 c3.

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,220
 And of course that is also not the correct move.

57
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,260
 King take c4.

58
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,500
 Which is once again, blunders checkmate in 4.

59
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,680
 And you know what, I've been blundering my king like a thousand times this game, so feel

60
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,940
 free to pause the video anytime you want to, because I think it will always be some sort

61
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:54,520
 of checkmate from now on, when my king is literally in his side of the board.

62
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,480
 f3.

63
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,800
 That is not the right move, and even though king d3 looks real fun, I have to play it

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,040
 for the video's sake.

65
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,180
 King d5, and would you look at that.

66
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,160
 King d5, is a great, move.

67
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,920
 Who would have thought.

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,920
 Knight e2.

69
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,920
 Aha!

70
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,960
 Counter-attack time!

71
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,780
 Bishop d6.

72
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,320
 Queen h4.

73
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,800
 Rook e8.

74
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,320
 Queen d4 check.

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,400
 King e6 is forced.

76
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,840
 Keep checking please, as long as you keep checking with your queen, there is always

77
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,200
 a chance that you will blunder her.

78
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,640
 And just as I was talking about it, knight takes d4.

79
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,200
 F takes e4.

80
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:49,620
 Okay, now since I'm up a full queen, I think we can all agree, that I cannot lose this

81
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,580
 mission anymore.

82
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,120
 Queen h4 check.

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,240
 Let's just finish this game, since the video is getting kinda long.

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,880
 g3.

85
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,840
 Queen takes e4.

86
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,920
 d3.

87
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,760
 That blunders a rook.

88
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,760
 King f2.

89
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,360
 I'll take this pawn as well.

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,960
 King f3.

91
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,160
 Bishop c7.

92
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
 Bishop f4.

93
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
 Okay fine.

94
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,960
 Knight takes f4 check.

95
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,120
 King d6.

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
 c4.

97
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,120
 g5.

98
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,840
 Knight e2.

99
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,180
 That blunders a king, queen takes e2.

100
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,200
 Checkmate.

101
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:37,760
 After all of those savage king blunders, I can finally say, mission, accomplished.

102
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:52,760
