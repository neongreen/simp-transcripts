00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 If a piece or pawn lets their king down, which means they are captured with check.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,560
 And this will give me a copyright strike, so let's just change it to the video ends.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:20,000
 So let's sum it up. If a capture comes with a check, the video ends. Let's go.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 I normally don't take on challenges that are too easy, but you know, I can't argue with money.

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,720
 We get a 149 from the US. E4. And the best thing is, he cannot check me in this position,

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,760
 no matter how hard he tries. E5. Since this challenge is quite easy,

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:51,440
 let's go for a risky opening line. D4. Queen E7. Very aggressive. I'll take this pawn.

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:01,280
 Queen takes. Ah ha, now queen takes E4 comes with a check. Therefore, knight C3. Well of course

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:11,840
 queen takes C3 also ends the video, but who plays like that anyway? Right? Well no one plays like

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,280
 that either. And even though I should have ended the video right now, I'll answer some of your

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,880
 comments to make the video longer instead. You're actually miserable, sad. Step outside.

12
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,440
 I disagree, there is covid out there, and if there's no reason to go out, not only me,

13
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,240
 but no one should go outside. Zero missed win when you show us that you can win in one move

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,880
 several time, good stockfish. Fun fact, all of those missed checkmate in one in the video were

15
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,720
 considered as blunders instead of missed win, and just like you, I also don't understand why.

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:58,240
 It is fascinating how a king can easily get a harem, it's very cool to even have 4 wives at a

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,800
 time, very cool. Well, until you realize that your new wives are actually pawns,

18
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:20,560
 who were technically men, that changed their gender.
