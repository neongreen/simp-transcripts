1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 100 rated chess, but Edward has to change gender.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 Too easy.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,680
 For those of you who don't know, Edward is actually the E pawn,

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,240
 which means that I have to promote this pawn to a queen, before the game ends.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,000
 E3.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,080
 Not very aggressive.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,200
 Since Edward must not die, let's go for...

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,080
 D5.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,720
 The idea is-

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,760
 What the f*** was that?

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,780
 Wow.

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,600
 Alright.

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,360
 I mean that's good for me anyway.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,960
 D4.

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,600
 Okay the idea is to take out all of these pawns so that Edward can become...

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,320
 A passed...

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,460
 pawn.

18
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,720
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor.

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,600
 Here, let me prove it to you.

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
 Knight F6.

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,200
 I mean if he was a paid actor, he would leave his king there for my bishop to skewer his wife next move.

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,200
 There we go, that 100% proves that he's not a paid actor.

23
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,440
 DxE3.

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,240
 Okay now even though this pawn is on the E file, he was originally the D pawn,

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,760
 so his name is still David and definitely not Edward,

26
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,840
 because moving to another place doesn't mean you can change your name that easily.

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
 Dude.

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,880
 This king is having like a cubic meter of testosterone in his body right now.

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,320
 ExD2.

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,960
 Alright, two obstacles down, only one to go.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,160
 And he doesn't even take my pawn.

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,920
 Alright, I think it's time to take the risk.

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,000
 Edward to E5.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,600
 So based on how he's been playing until now, I think we can all see that he is a sandbagger,

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,560
 which means he will be resigning the game very soon.

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,560
 So I have to take the risk and promote my E pawn before he can do that.

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,280
 QxB7.

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,680
 That blunders a woman and a king by knight G4 discovered check king H5 G6 checkmate with a pawn.

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,680
 But of course, I have a much more important task to do here.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
 E4.

41
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,240
 Come on, just take my rook, take my knight and give me those free tempos.

42
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,920
 Or take my bishop and blunder your queen instead.

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,320
 I have to take that, because I need my queen to help Edward in case he decides to play seriously.

44
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,960
 Kf4.

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,640
 I can't take the risk and push my pawn now, so I'll make.

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,320
 A bishop.

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,720
 I mean making a queen is just telling him to resign, which is not good for me.

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,880
 Ke5.

49
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,560
 Okay, now I still need to take this pawn out.

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,360
 What the f-

51
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:57,840
