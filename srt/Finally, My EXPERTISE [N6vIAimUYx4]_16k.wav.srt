00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 100 rated chess, but you must justify all of your opponent's blunders with logical fallacies,

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,800
 these reasonings must be different, and if you are unable to do so. The video ends.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,320
 Ha, in case you don't know, I majored in flexing when I was in university.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:26,640
 We get a 163 from Norway, with diamond membership, and spoiler alert, I don't think that this guy is

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,760
 Magnus Carlsen. E4, so normally when I take on a challenge, I usually build myself a good strategy

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,280
 to fight against my unpredictable 100 rated opponents, but for this very video, there is

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,120
 absolutely no need for any strategies, because I strongly believe that there is no such blunder

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:53,840
 that I cannot make a logical fallacy to excuse for. E5. Not a blunder. D4, I mean it's gonna be

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:02,400
 difficult to flex if he blunders his queen right now, but who plays like that anyway. Right? Ha,

10
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,280
 not even close. Bishop D3, just please delay your queen blunder, it's still a little bit too early

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:18,080
 for that. E takes D4. Knight F3. Ha, I mean even if he blunders his queen right now, I can still

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,560
 say that he sacrificed his queen to put my knight on the rim, which is a very smart tactic. He saved

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:33,200
 his queen instead. I'll take this pawn. Knight F6, knight C3 D6 bishop G5 bishop A6 very aggressive.

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,800
 Ok. Here we go. Knight D5, brilliant move by the way, and I think we all know that there's

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,880
 a gigantic chance that I'll have to find an excuse for his very next move. And there it is,

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,320
 that blunders a woman, but actually, that did not blunder the woman, because he is actually

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,160
 sacrificing his queen to unpin his knight from my bishop, and you know what they say, the best way

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,360
 to unpin a piece, is to sacrifice the piece behind the pin. Therefore, knight takes E7, and as you

19
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:14,240
 can see, his knight is not pinned anymore. Bishop takes E7. Queen D3 bishop C5 long castle D5 bishop

20
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:21,440
 F6 G F6 E D5 rook G8 knight F5. He should be able to see, that rook takes G2 is blundering queen

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:31,840
 E4 check winning a full rook. Right? Aha! I understand now, he is actually baiting me to go

22
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,360
 queen E4 check to fork his rook, and then instead of moving the king away from my pieces, he'll go

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,640
 king F8 to provoke me to check him again instead of taking his rook, which blunders my queen to

24
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,400
 his bishop, therefore rook G2 is actually a gambit of a rook to try his chance at winning my queen.

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:59,120
 But still, queen E4 check. He'll go king F8 for sure. Ha! You see, this is entirely his plan.

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:07,440
 D6, of course I don't even care about that rook anyway. C takes D6, that blunders a king to queen

27
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,360
 E7 check king G8 is forced queen E8 a very textbook back rank checkmate in two, but since

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,400
 of course there's no way I can make an excuse for blundering a king, I'll have to end the video.

29
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,720
 Ha! Mission accomplished.
