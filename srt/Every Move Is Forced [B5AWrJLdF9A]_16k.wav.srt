 100 rated chess, but you must state in chat what your next move will be before taking your current

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,720
 move. Well, I normally don't take on impossible challenges like this, but I'm actually sick right

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:21,520
 now, so I decided to go with a shorter video. We get a 249 from Australia. Aha! I'm moving first,

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:29,200
 so I have to tell him what I'm gonna do in my next move. Knight f3. E4, and this means that

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:38,640
 I will have to play knight f3 next move, regardless of what happens now. E5. Just as I expected. I

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,280
 really want bishop c4 next, but there's a chance that he'll play d5 after my knight f3, which means

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,960
 I will be blundering a piece. Therefore, let's take a more cautious approach. Knight c3. And as

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:01,600
 promised from last move, knight f3. F6. That blunders a pawn, but I cannot take it because

9
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,320
 knight c3 is forced. But then there comes a question. Do I take this pawn on my next move?

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,320
 I mean there is a chance that he will play d6 on his next move, which means I will blunder a knight,

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:24,720
 but that chance is relatively small. You know what? I can't risk it. Bishop c4, knight c3.

12
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:33,120
 And let's make this clear, I'm just trying to be safe, and I'm not a coward. Bishop d6. Weird move.

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:48,960
 I'll castle next. Bishop c4. Knight h6. d3, castle. F5. Aha! Now it gets serious. You see,

14
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,480
 the reason why this challenge is so hard, is that I cannot know whether he will take this pawn or

15
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:01,840
 not. For example, now I have to play d3, but I also have to say what my next move is, and just

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,360
 for context, if I say my next move is a3, then things may go like d3 is forced, f takes e4,

17
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,880
 a3 is forced, and then I'll lose my knight. And even worse, I can't just say e takes f5 or d

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:23,200
 takes e4 on my next move, because if he just decides to push this f-pawn, none of those moves

19
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,760
 can happen, which means I'll have to end the video. So I guess, bishop h6, d3. I mean this has

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,520
 to be the safest approach to this situation, but if he goes crazy and move his knight again,

21
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:46,080
 I'm gonna lose a bishop for free. Thank you. And you know what? I think I have a great idea.

22
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:58,560
 Knight e5, bishop takes h6. Exactly as planned. Queen h5, knight e5. Alright, here's how it's

23
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,040
 gonna go. He's gonna take my knight here, and then queen h5 comes with some random checkmate that I

24
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,960
 haven't seen yet. Or he's gonna find the best move of queen h4 and absolutely destroy me on the

25
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:22,080
 chessboard. Ha! Noob. In this position, there is a forced checkmate in 7 moves, so feel free to

26
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,320
 pause the video right now to find the sequence, and the answer is obviously queen h5 check king

27
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,040
 e7 queen f7 check king d6 is forced knight b5 check and even though the continuation should be

28
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:44,000
 king c5 queen d5 king before a3 king a4 knight c3 bishop c3 b3 mate, he actually went for king c6,

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,600
 which shorthand the game down to queen d5 mate. And as you can see here, since all of those moves

30
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,240
 were so obvious and forcing, I was able to foretell everything during the sequence. Mission

31
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,460
 Accomplished.
