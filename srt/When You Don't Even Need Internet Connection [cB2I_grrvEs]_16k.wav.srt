00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 100 rated chess, but you're fasting, you can't capture until move 10, and after that you can

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,800
 only capture once every 3 moves. Yesterday was a total disaster, so today we take on an easier

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,960
 challenge. We get a 100 rated guy from India. E4. Pushing center pawns is definitely not a

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,920
 good idea as I cannot make any captures in the opening, therefore. B6. Slow and steady,

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:37,760
 just like a casual foreplay. Qh5. Bb7. Qxh7 is forcing my king to take his queen which ends

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:48,160
 the video. But who plays like that anyway? Right? No worries. Nc6. I mean I cannot take his queen,

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,200
 but no one said I cannot attack her. And also no one said that he cannot lunder her. Nf6.

8
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,840
 I don't really care if he continues to blunder his queen or not, just please don't play this move.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:12,880
 Nb5. Ah ha! He's trying to fork my king and my rook. So I guess. D6. Nc7 can still happen.

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,760
 Thank you. I cannot let a trade happens right now.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,520
 Nbb8. Please stop moving that horsey. You are killing me sir.

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:32,000
 That blunders many things in many different ways. But I have to go with. Qc8. This is not a

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:45,280
 checkmate by the way. I repeat, not a checkmate. Thank god. G6. The challenge said I cannot capture

14
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,520
 until move 10, which means I can start capturing from move 10, and now it is move number 9,

15
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,240
 which is the last move according to the challenge, which means if he lets me survive this one move

16
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,800
 right here, I will make sure this guy cries all his tear out and never wants to play chess again.
