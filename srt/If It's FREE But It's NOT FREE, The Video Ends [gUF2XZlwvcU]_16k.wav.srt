1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 If a hanging piece, not porn, is not free, the video ends.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Okay, I think that right now, most of you guys are like, what does that even f*cking mean?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 But no worries, because I think I know what he meant.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And even if I'm wrong, it still doesn't matter, because here, I'm the one, who writes the rules.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 Explaining the whole thing may be a bit too time-consuming. Therefore, let's just find an opponent.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 That was fast. We get a 1-32 from Australia.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 E4.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 E5.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Still theory.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Knight c3.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Knight f6.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Aha! F. No.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 If I play f4 here, he may going to blunder knight take c4, which hangs a horsey.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 But since he's already won a porn before that, that horsey is not free.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 You know? Like, it's free, but it's not really free, it's more like a trade of a knight for a porn, which is kinda similar to what the challenge was talking about.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 So I guess, d3. I need to make it really clear, that my porn, is protected.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 d6. Very solid.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Bishop g? No.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 If I play bishop g4, he may decide to move his knight, which blunders his queen, but after I take his queen, he can take my bishop back, so his queen is not really for free, which also breaks the challenge's rule.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 So I guess, bishop e2.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 c5.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 Knight f3.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 d5. Very aggressive.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 That blunders this porn, but I'll take this one first.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 There's no way he's going queen takes d5, blundering his queen but not for free, right?

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 e4. That blunders another porn.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 Two porns in a row, porn lives obviously don't matter.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Bishop g4.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 H? No.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 If I play h3, he may decide to blunder his bishop, but after h takes g4, there is knight takes g4, winning back a porn, which makes his bishop not really free, which ends the video.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 So I guess, e5.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Oh, wait. I blundered.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 Now if he blunders his knight, then after e takes f6, there is queen takes f6, winning back a porn, so his knight is not free, which ends the video.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Nah. I'm worrying too much, there's no way he doesn't see that his horsey is being attacked, right?

35
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Not only he didn't move his knight, but he also blunders his bishop. And this is also not for free.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 What the f-

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 [Outro]
