00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
 I'm better than my viewers but it's this monstrosity.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,880
 Ha! Like I'm gonna be scared. Ladies and gentlemen and everyone else,

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,320
 welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers, the series that I play against my viewers

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,760
 and absolutely destroy them, and the victim this time is a guy called, RiaSaeBoy1. And don't judge

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,920
 my pronunciation. Bishop takes rook takes bishop takes rook takes bishop takes, king a7 is laundering

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:36,160
 bishop b6 rook b6 bishop b6 king b8 bishop a7 rook a7 bishop a7 checkmate in four. Therefore, king b8.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:46,160
 Bishop takes f4. That still blunders the queen. Rook g8. Bishop c8 rook g3 bishop 4g3 knight c8.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,600
 The grandmasters always say, knight on the rim is dim, but I didn't really have any choices.

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:01,680
 Bishop a7 check. Knight takes. Bishop checks again. King c8. Rook h8 check. Blocking with the

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,560
 knight should be better here, but things like bishop e6 totally lock down my king is actually

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,200
 pretty concerning. So I guess, I'll block with my bishop. To be clear, I'm not a coward, I'm just

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,920
 trying to play as humanly as possible. Rook f8. He wants to double up his rook, which is really

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:31,920
 dangerous, therefore, rook a2. If I can't defend, I'll attack. Bishop e3. Okay. Here we go. d5.

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,200
 I'm sorry Edward, but you need to die so that I can create some counterplay. Edward is dead. Rook

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,640
 g6 check. I mean he can literally pull his bishop back and my attack will be stalled for at least a

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,240
 few moves, but who knows, maybe he'll play king h3 and totally block down all of his rooks.

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:02:00,960
 Well, very convenient. Knight e6. Bishop takes d5. That blunders a rook. Alright,

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,800
 now let's try our best to get a draw. That escalated really quickly. Bishop d7 king h4

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:18,640
 rook g4 king h3 rook f4 bishop e6 bishop e6. Checkmate. I'm better than my viewers.
