1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
 100 rated chess, but you're a paid actor. I will pay you $1 for every point of material you lose,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,880
 10 if the opponent opens bong cloud, 20 if you lose, and another 25 if your opponent

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,640
 checkmate you with a pawn. Every point of material you win will deduct $1 from your pay.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,400
 If you win, you are paid nothing, you are also not allowed to sacrifice any pieces or pawns.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,760
 Okay at first he sounds very generous, but let's take a good look at this challenge.

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,640
 This part doesn't make any sense, there is no way to tell the difference between a blunder and a

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,640
 sacrifice, so I will remove this part. No way opponent is playing bong cloud, no way they can

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,400
 checkmate me with a pawn, so basically I can only get 20 bucks plus the materials that I lose.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:54,960
 But still, money is money. We get a 1 0 6 from Canada. E4. I mean what can go wrong anyway,

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,800
 I just have to self-destruct all of my pieces, avoid taking any pieces, and then lose the game.

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:13,520
 Right? E6. Not very aggressive. Qh5. First 9 dollars, here I come. D5. Of course I'm not

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:22,320
 taking anything this game doesn't matter how tempting it seems. D3. Nf6. Ah ha, now he has

13
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,640
 finally attacked my queen, and to elevate things a little bit faster. E5. Attacking his knight is

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,840
 the best way to get it to move. Or not. Bishop blocks. Take this bishop and I'll move my king

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:44,400
 aside, or you can just ignore that side and take my queen. Your choice. I didn't even know that was

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:52,800
 an option. F4. Somehow I have a very bad feeling about this game. Knight back to F6. That blunders

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:59,280
 2 different pieces, but of course, I'm not taking any of them. I can't believe trying to lose pieces

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:10,320
 can be this difficult. Ha! Finally. Taking that bishop is losing 3 dollars, king D1. Bishop C1.

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:17,600
 For the second time in this game, I didn't know that was an option. C4. Dude. Please at least

20
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:26,480
 take a pawn. Thank you. Knight C3. The plan is very simple. If I move my knight, he'll move his

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:34,560
 knight. Exactly as planned. Knight B5. This move will prevent him from moving his queen out which

22
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,440
 may checkmate me sooner than I can sacrifice my pieces. Nevermind. That blunders a queen and a

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:50,000
 fork at the same time, so of course, I'll push a pawn. Bishop D2. I have nothing else to say.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,880
 B4. Take it please. That is also fine, his queen coming closer will help in sacrificing my pieces,

25
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:05,760
 so I guess I just have to push my pawns. Queen E1 check. That blunders the woman again,

26
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,680
 but king C2. Plus 5 dollars incoming. I mean having 1 piece attacking my rook was probably

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,640
 not enough, so he decided to attack it with his bishop too. But anyway, queen D2 is actually

28
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,160
 forcing my knight to take which loses 9 dollars because king B1 queen B2 checkmate in 1 or king

29
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:34,480
 B3 queen B2 king A4 queen B4 checkmate in 2. So I guess. Rook D1. If I have 2 pieces guarding a

30
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:45,360
 square, he won't dare to put his queen on that square. Maybe. Thank you. A6. Please at least

31
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,640
 take a pawn. Or blunder a queen, your woman your choice. Don't want this to happen. King B3.

32
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,200
 Queen D4. That still blunders the queen, but quite frankly, who cares anymore. Knight D6 check.

33
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,800
 Ha, if it is a check, he has to take my knight. I hate this game.

34
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:19,120
 How can losing pieces be even harder than winning them? Knight C6. You know what? If my opponent

35
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,320
 doesn't want to capture, I have to at least lose this game for that 20 bucks. C5. Queen B4 queen

36
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:37,440
 B2 please. Fine. C6 check. No way you're not taking this. Bishop E2. Take this too please.

37
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:50,240
 Knight check. I've changed my mind. King C2. C5. Bishop H5. F5. Ha, it's my turn now you mother******.

38
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,920
 Check. He'll take it for sure.

39
00:04:53,920 --> 00:05:01,520
 Knight E4. Why do I have to play with this guy in this challenge?

40
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,240
 Ha. Finally. Rook up rook over rook over rook over bishop takes rook up pawn takes pawn up

41
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,760
 knight A8. Now it is move number 31, the game continued for 10 entire moves more.

42
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:26,640
 But I made no money. Rook A3. Checkmate. If my calculation is correct, it is 49 dollars,

43
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,800
 and even though I lost this game, mission accomplished.

44
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:45,600
