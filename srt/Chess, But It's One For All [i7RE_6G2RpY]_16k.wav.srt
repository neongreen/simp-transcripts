1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 If a piece, or pawn, gets captured, identical pieces, or pawns, can't move anymore.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Ah ha! This challenge reminds me of Halloween.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 You see, when a bunch of kids comes to your home and ask for candy, you can just refuse one of them, and everyone walks away.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Empty handed.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 We get a 1 54 from Peru.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 G3. Not very aggressive.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 But actually, that should be good for me, since I don't really want any captures to happen too early.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 D5.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Bishop H3.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Ah ha! Now my best move should be bishop takes H3.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 But then according to the rules, my bishops won't be able to move, and if this bishop can't move, then my king won't be able to castle, and I have to develop my rook in a weirdo way.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Also, if I just leave the situation like this, he may be going to take my bishop, which also leads to the same situation.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Therefore, E6.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 B3. Again, not very aggressive.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Knight F6.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 E3. This guy has to be the nicest 100 rated I have ever met.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Knight C6.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Bishop A3. Once again, offering a bishop trade.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 But I think, I can take it this time.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And of course, now my light square bishop cannot move anymore, and even if he doesn't take my dark square bishop back, I won't be able to move it either.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Knight takes A3.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 I'll castle.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 C3.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Queen D6.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Knight C2.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Let's play a bit more aggressively.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Knight E4.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Queen F3.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 E5.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 Since my bishop cannot move, it would be perfect if he can make a trade.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Thank you.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Rook A takes C8.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 D4.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 That blunders a pawn.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 But should I even take it though?

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Because after I take that pawn, all of my pawns cannot move.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 No.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 I think I should take

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 this pawn.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 This move looks pretty bad in normal chess.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 But I believe that it should be my best choice for this video.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 He takes D4.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Rook C2 E8.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Queen E2.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 That blunders a queen.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Knight takes C3.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Oh.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Wait.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Now if he takes my rook, I won't be able to take his queen, because of the rules.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Are you serious?

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 He is really taking his time here.

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Oh.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He chose to move his king instead.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And now offering a draw.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 You know what?

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Even though I can win a full queen, my queen won't be able to move after that.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Therefore, let's accept it.

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Mission kinda accomplished.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:32,000
