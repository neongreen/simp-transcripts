00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 100 rated chess, but you really like your opponent, you must move your piece, or pawn,

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,520
 as close as you can to your opponent's last moved piece.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,680
 This is going to be annoying, we get a 1 1 2 from Spain.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,720
 E4, so normally I would develop a good plan for each challenge and then strictly follow

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,520
 that plan to get the most optimal outcome, but for this video, I'll say that the plan

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,560
 is to pray that our opponent won't do anything too crazy.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,840
 E5, now I need to move as close to his E pawn as possible.

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,240
 Therefore, D4 is kinda forced.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,480
 D5.

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,720
 Ah ha.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:46,480
 E takes D5 is forced, the closest distance possible, is definitely 0.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,200
 E takes D4.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,040
 Queen takes is forced, I mean if he plays something like knight C6 right now, that will

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,920
 force me to take his knight and then blunders my queen, but he should be able to see, that

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,280
 I always have queen E3 check which forces knight E7 blocking his dark square bishop.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,480
 Right?

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:14,080
 Of course, bishop E6 and C6 are still dangerous threats to my queen, therefore, queen A4 check.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,280
 I mean if he can just not block with the bishop and forces queen takes blundering a queen,

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,480
 that will be very convenient.

20
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,840
 That was literally the most convenient move possible.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,120
 D6, for the video's sake, let's just say that this pawn is also only 1 square away from

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,320
 the king, which means it is equal to queen D7, so I totally didn't have to sacrifice

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,200
 my queen, and let's just hope that he'll play king F6, which allows bishop G5 instead of

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,480
 having to move my queen again.

25
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,360
 Queen takes D6.

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,800
 That is very unfortunate.

27
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,680
 Queen C6 is forced.

28
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,800
 Alright.

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,480
 It's fine, it's not like I need a queen to win this game anyway.

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
 Woman's dead.

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,440
 C4 is forced.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,180
 I mean if he can just take this pawn and allow me to take back, then we don't have to worry

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,920
 about our queen anymore.

34
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,640
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor.

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,840
 Bishop takes C4 is forced.

36
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:26,320
 Ha, now the queens are off the board, there is nothing that can go wrong anymore.

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,440
 Are you serious?

38
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,080
 Bishop D5 is forced.

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,000
 King takes D5.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,520
 Knight C3 check.

41
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,200
 In no world do you keep advancing your king here.

42
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,840
 B4 is forced.

43
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,960
 I can't believe that this guy is absolutely destroying me, by advancing his king into

44
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,480
 my territory.

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,080
 King takes A4.

46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,400
 Bishop D2 is forced.

47
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,640
 Aha!

48
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,920
 Thank you.

49
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,120
 B5 is forced.

50
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,560
 Some people may say that this move puts my B pawn further away from the king due to the

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,600
 Pythagorean theorem.

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,840
 But no, I have legally decided that it is still following the rules.

53
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
 King takes.

54
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,400
 A4 is kinda forced, and I've just realized that no matter where he's moving his king

55
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,320
 to, I will always have to sacrifice my bishop.

56
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,000
 King C6.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,720
 Bishop A5 is forced.

58
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,920
 I mean a lot of people actually cannot see that their rooks can also go forward from

59
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,520
 the starting position, so maybe this guy won't see it either.

60
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,600
 You know what, this challenge is obviously impossible, so I'm just gonna end the video

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,040
 right here.

62
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,120
 Mission is failed.

63
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,000
 Have a great day.

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:57,880
