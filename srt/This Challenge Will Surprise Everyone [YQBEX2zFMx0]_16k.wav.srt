00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge on the 12th move. Not many challenges can get this

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,840
 many reactions, so I have to say that I'm very eager to uncover it. We get a 128 from Mexico.

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:26,720
 Very handsome. E4. Knight c6. d4. Take over the entire center. Knight f6. Tips for the beginners

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:34,640
 out there. Don't play like this. E5. In case you are wondering why I suggested you guys avoid this

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:44,480
 opening, I'm pretty sure you're going to see the reason. Right. Now. There we go. Queen takes g4.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,000
 And guess what, I'm pretty sure the other horsey will also be blundered very soon.

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:01:02,080
 I solemnly swear that this guy is not a paid actor. Queen takes d4. d6. Bishop c4.

8
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:10,800
 F6. I think Stockfish wants me to take on f6 right here. But I actually prefer, e6.

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,800
 Completely locking down his position, so maybe he's gonna sacrifice a queen to make room for

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:28,160
 the other pieces. Of course that doesn't happen. Let's play a little bit tricky. Bishop g5. Oh no

11
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:37,680
 my bishop. F takes g5. That blunders a rook. Resignation. And since I can only uncover the

12
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:54,080
 challenge on the 12th move, I guess we have no challenges today.

13
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,780
 Don't worry, I'll be back.
