 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge after moving the second piece. Not pawn!

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,240
 A bit scary with these 9 king reactions, but let's go! We get a 1 0 2 from Algeria.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,800
 E4. Since the challenge starts with a piece, we'll maximize the pawns first.

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:34,720
 E5. D4. Queen F6. I'll take. Queen takes. Ah ha, now knight C3 or bishop D3 defending the pawn

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,680
 should be my best continuation, but it's still too early to make a piece move and provoke the

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:48,960
 challenge. Therefore, F3. Queen F6. Queen H5 will be a bit annoying, I'll prevent it first.

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:01:00,080
 Bishop C5. Queen G6. Queen G3 is also not good for my king. H5. Ha, now this queen is officially

8
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:10,800
 harmless on this side of the board. Bishop B6. C4. Queen C6. Okay this move will be a bit dangerous,

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:17,360
 but since we don't have many pawn moves left to consider. B4. This blunders a pawn to queen F6.

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,280
 Knight C3. Brilliant move. Queen C3. Bishop D2. Queen move. C5 and I win a piece back,

11
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,120
 but I'm buying the chance that he won't see queen F6 as his queen was on that square just a few

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:39,600
 moves ago. Ha! Wrong square. That blunders a woman, and I think it's worthy. Alright, that is

13
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,200
 one piece move for me, but that comes with a very good chance that my opponent is just gonna resign.

14
00:01:45,920 --> 00:02:00,240
 Right. Now. I'll trap this bishop. Knight A6. Cb6 Ab6. And since I've already trapped his bishop,

15
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:08,320
 let's also trap his knight. C6. Alright, the next piece move activates the challenge,

16
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,440
 and since the challenge has 9 king reactions, it comes to me that even though this is a very

17
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,360
 dangerous decision, there is no way I will turn this idea down. King F2. Come at me baby.

18
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:31,440
 That piece is now your second king, same rules applied. Ha! My king is also my king, and since

19
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,840
 my king is already my king, I will continue to treat my king like he is my king. Therefore,

20
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,280
 the challenge is now just an absolutely normal game, after a few more moves. Queen C8 King A7

21
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,560
 Rook A6. Checkmate. I cannot afford to show you guys the entire game due to smurfing issues.

22
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
 But still. Mission. Accomplished.

23
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:11,360
