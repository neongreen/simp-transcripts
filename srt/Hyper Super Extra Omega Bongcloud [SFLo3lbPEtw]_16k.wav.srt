00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 100 rated chess, but you are sexist, your king must get more captures than your queen,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,160
 open parenthesis, your queen must get at least one capture, close parenthesis.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,440
 Disclaimer, I'm not sexist.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,160
 E3. The royal couple are the protagonist and deuteragonist of this video,

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,640
 therefore, I'll open the way for them.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,280
 E4. That's our first chance. D5. C takes queen takes and we're done with the woman.

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
 But I guess we're stuck with the woman.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,560
 Bishop C5. I'm trying to get his eyes to tunnel vision into this specific area of the board.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,760
 Work like a charm.

10
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,960
 Queen takes D5. Alright, one capture for the wife, two more captures for the husband.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,960
 E4. Queen D4. Believe it or not, my queen is actually pretty safe on D4.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,480
 Queen E2. Here we go. King E7. Push him baby.

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:17,520
 G4. Very aggressive. But since I'm not a coward, I have to be. Even more aggressive.

14
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,760
 Knight H3. H5. This knight is very suspicious.

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,760
 Knight G5 check. King F6.

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:38,160
 H4. HG4. Bishop G2. That blunders a pawn. Of course it's a brilliant move,

17
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:43,440
 and he should obviously see, that rook takes H4 is risking his own king's life.

18
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:50,160
 Nevermind. Queen G1 is best, but if queen blocks I'll have to trade queens which leads to my queen

19
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,240
 capturing unnecessary too many pieces and will create more problems for my king. Therefore,

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:05,840
 I'll keep things simple. Rook H1. Coward. King F4. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,120
 Knight A3. This guy really likes to put his horses on the edge of the board.

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,640
 G takes F3. This is actually a massive blunder, and in fact, any moves could have been a blunder

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:30,800
 in that scenario, so there is no problem if he doesn't see D3. As expected. This is a good

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,320
 chance to complete the challenge. Bishop G4. Bishop takes queen. F2. Queen takes bishop. Takes

25
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:42,080
 king. Takes king. Takes. My king has officially captured more materials than my queen, which means

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,440
 the rest of the game is now just a normal game, therefore I'll have to end the video here to

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,720
 avoid being called a smurf. Have a great day.

28
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:04,960
