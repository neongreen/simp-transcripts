00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 I'm better than my viewers. Yeah of course I am. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another episode

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,560
 of I'm better than my viewers. Today's challenger is a guy called Pythag, #secondtry. I'll take this

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:23,280
 rook first. Let's see if his second try is better than the first one. Bishop takes g7. Rook takes g7.

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:31,280
 It's never wrong to just give a check. Rook takes rook. Rook takes rook. Alright, now the game truly

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,640
 begins. The best move right now should be blocking with his knight. But I mean if he can just decide

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,000
 to block with his queen, that will be very convenient. Sadly he's not a paid actor. I'll

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,680
 take this rook. I mean there were too many things to take, so may as well just take the highest value

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:58,400
 piece. Queen takes e5. That blunders a horsey, c takes d4. Well maybe instead of a horsey,

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:06,000
 he can also give me a queen. Of course it doesn't happen. Knight takes rook takes pawn takes queen

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,720
 takes d4 check. Bishop blocks. I'll say that there are a little bit too many pieces on this diagonal.

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:21,680
 Queen takes b2. A queen sacrifice, and since I'm obviously not a coward. I'll take it. You know

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,600
 what they say, if you see someone sacrificing a woman, they are definitely making a mistake.

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:36,240
 c takes d3. Ah ha, so this is what he was trying to do. Bishop takes is just a huge blunder for

14
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,240
 allowing rook c1 check, which forces my king to advance forward unless I want to be checkmated.

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,760
 And knight takes pawn takes knight takes bishop takes bishop takes will also allow rook c1 check,

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,880
 and even though it is not as dangerous as the other variation, it is still very lethal,

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,920
 so after spending like 2 minutes on the clock, I finally found. Knight takes a4. That was really

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,640
 dangerous back there, but as someone who has to put the knight on the rim multiple times for the

19
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:13,440
 videos, I was supposed to find that move. Rook c2 rook c2 dc2. Knight takes b6. Queen takes will

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:22,320
 be very convenient, but there is no way that can ever happen. Bishop takes. Well at least there is

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:31,280
 no way he's taking with king. Of course. Rook blocks. ea3 rook c2 bishop f7 I'll take this

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,400
 horse ea2 ah ha. Now rook takes should be the best move, but since I want to put my rook on c7,

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:49,760
 let's try to take a risk. Bishop takes b3. Rook c7. Bishop a2. Rook h7. Alright, come down and

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:03:00,000
 check me with your only woman left. Woman check. King g2. Queen b2 check. Ah ha. I figured that it

25
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,120
 will take too long to checkmate him, especially when I still haven't seen any checkmates yet.

26
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,440
 Therefore, king g1 queen b1 king g2 queen b2 king g1. Queen b1 is drawn by repetition,

27
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,640
 which means I'm better than my viewers because I managed to get a draw from a worse position,

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,960
 but then he went for? Queen a1 check. King g2. Alright, now we know that he doesn't want a draw,

29
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,160
 let's go for a win, but then in this exact position, something unexpected happened.

30
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:40,800
 Queen b2 draw by repetition. Well, I'm better than my viewers.

31
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,640
 So,

32
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,220
 (upbeat music)

33
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,800
 (upbeat music)
