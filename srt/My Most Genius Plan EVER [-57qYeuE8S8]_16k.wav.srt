00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 100 rated chess, but you are Genghis Khan, you can only take with a horsey, promote to a horsey,

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:12,400
 and every second move must be horsey. The last part obviously sounds way too difficult,

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,400
 so I'm just gonna delete that part away. And to be honest, it still sounds way too impossible.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:28,960
 E4. E5. D4. Ah ha, normally I would be taking this pawn immediately, but since only my knights can

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,200
 do the captures, knight C6 instead. D takes knight takes F4 knight back. H4. Very aggressive.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,600
 Bishop C5, since he's already pushed his king's pawns, the plan is obviously to checkmate his

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,400
 king before he can capture all of my knights. B4. That blunders a pawn, and as the challenge

8
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:59,600
 suggests, I have to take with horsey. C3. Knight back again. F5. This guy literally hasn't moved

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:09,120
 anything besides his pawns. Knight F6. E5. That blunders a pawn. G4. That continues to blunder

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:17,440
 another pawn. Not gonna lie, this is really convenient. Bishop E2. Ah ha, my knights are

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,080
 obviously worth more than his bishops, because they are the only pieces that I can use to make

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,520
 a capture, so I guess. Queen E7. I don't even care about this fork, the only thing I care about is to

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:38,000
 checkmate my opponent before he gets to capture all of my horses. Bishop G5. Ah ha. Here comes

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,800
 trouble. Queen E4. I mean he should be able to see, that I'm clearly attacking his rook right now,

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:52,960
 so taking my knight is definitely not a very good idea. Right? I can take that bishop, but again,

16
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,400
 the target is his king. I still haven't found any checkmate patterns yet, but it never hurts to

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,120
 give a check, and who knows, maybe he'll decide to go king D2 bishop E3 king E1 bishop F2 and we

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:13,520
 make a draw by repetition. Nevermind. That blunders a queen. Knight E3 royal fork. Please resign.

19
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,120
 Or not. Now comes the question. Do I take his queen? The most obvious outcome after I take his

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,400
 queen, is that he will take my knight, and then I won't be able to capture anything for the rest of

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:35,920
 the game. You know what? I have an idea. Knight takes D1. Bishop takes. Random move random move.

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:45,600
 All right, it is time to deliver my ultimate plan. I offer a draw. Draw accepted. Ha. Mission

23
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:54,080
 accomplished.

24
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:01,920
