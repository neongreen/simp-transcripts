00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 100 rated chess, but if you can blunder a pawn, you have to. No love for those soldiers today,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:16,240
 we get a 185 from Thailand. E4. Ah ha, F5 is just gambiting a pawn, which is not really a blunder,

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,680
 and D5 is just suggesting a pawn trade. Therefore, B5 is kinda forced. I mean blundering a pawn on

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,720
 the very first move of a chess game doesn't sound very positive, but as long as he doesn't get his

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,000
 queen out to absolutely destroy all of my pawns, there is absolutely nothing to be worried about.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,120
 Knight F3. Ah ha, now I can choose whether to end Edward's life or the G-pawn's life,

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,040
 and even though that was a tough choice, the guy with no name needs to go. I'm sorry the guy that

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,280
 doesn't have a name, but I'll try to write something on your gravestone. He's dead. And

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,720
 I've just realized, that now F5 is forced, which allows queen H5 checkmate in 1.

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:13,760
 This game sucks. Oh my god thank you very much. Knight F6. Ha, now queen H5 is not checkmating

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,280
 anymore, but I mean if he still decides to play it to give me a free queen, that will definitely

12
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:29,440
 be very convenient. Of course it doesn't happen. E5. Castle. Rook G8, I mean it will be very bad

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,360
 if he doesn't move his knight back, but I'm positive that he will do so. Nevermind. That

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,760
 forces me to blunder my H-pawn, therefore, knight takes E4. Man, now queen H5 rook G6 knight H7 will

15
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,200
 be very dangerous, but since he didn't see the checkmate in 1 last time, there is no way he's

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:58,560
 seeing that tactic here. Right? Ha, F takes E4 is kinda forced, because that also blunders the F-pawn.

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:09,120
 G3. No pawn to blunder anymore. I'll take this pawn. Knight D5. Ah ha, that threatens to take

18
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:18,480
 my C-pawn, and according to the rules, I have to let that happen. Knight takes E7. King D8. Knight

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:30,400
 takes A8. E3 is kinda forced. D3. That blunders a king, queen H1. Checkmate. Man, I can't believe

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:39,120
 I actually won that.
