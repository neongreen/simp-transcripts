1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 If a move is not very aggressive, the video ends.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 This is going to be short.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 But anyway, since I'm out of ideas, let's just find an opponent.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 We get a 132 from Brazil.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And it seems like this guy is wearing mask while exercising indoor.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 But anyway.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 E4.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 E4 is an aggressive opening move, and I think we can all agree with that.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 C6.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Very aggressive.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 This is called the Karokan defense, and even though a lot of people say that the Karokan is very drawish and passive,

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 I personally think that the exchange Karokan is very aggressive, which means the opening is very aggressive.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 D4.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Qa5 check.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Developing the queen first should always be very aggressive, and I think we can all agree with that.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Bd2.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 This is also very aggressive, because I attack his queen as soon as he develops it.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 Qa4.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Very aggressive.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 He chose to move his queen forward instead of retreating her, which also attacks my d-pawn, and since c3 or bishop c3 doesn't look very aggressive,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 I guess I should go with...

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 B4.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Ah, I can feel the testosterone level is increasing.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Na6.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Very aggressive.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 He attacks my b-pawn as soon as I moved it in an aggressive way.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 A3 defending the pawn and then knight c3 next move will most likely win his queen, or even a3, c5, knight c3, queen c6, b5 will also win a horsey.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 But sadly, a defending move is hardly considered as aggressive.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Therefore, bishop takes a6.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I need to counter his attack with an attack.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 B takes a6.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 Very aggressive.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 He chose to recapture with the pawn, so that his queen can stay on a much more active square, and also make room to develop his bishop.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Knight f3.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 A lot of people are going to argue that this is not an aggressive move, but actually, this move is very aggressive, since I want to defend my d-pawn with my knight,

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 so that I can push b5 later, and after my b-pawn is captured, I will have an open b-file for my rook.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 D6.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Very aggressive.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 He could obviously develop his bishop to b7, but instead, he decided that he wants to develop his bishop in the other way, so that he can use his open b-file for his rook.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 But anyway.

42
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 King e2.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 I didn't see any aggressive moves that look good, so this is my ultimate way to solve the problem.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Bishop g4.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Very aggressive.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 He attacks my king as soon as I move it, by delivering a double-pin skewer stuff.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But anyway.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 H3.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Moving a pawn one square like this is also very aggressive, because I attack his bishop as soon as he moves it.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Bishop takes f3.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Very aggressive.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 He chose to capture my knight instead of moving his bishop back.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 King takes f3.

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 I believe no one argues about this move.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 Knight f6.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Very aggressive.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 He develops his knight close to my king as soon as he sees my king is coming closer.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Rook he won.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Centralizing a rook is definitely an aggressive move.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 G6.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 I don't know what to say about this.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:23,000
