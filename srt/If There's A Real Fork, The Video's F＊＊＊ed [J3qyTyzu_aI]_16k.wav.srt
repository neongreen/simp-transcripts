1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
 If a piece attacks 3 pieces, or pawns, at the same time, the video ends.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,120
 This is going to be short.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,080
 We get a 1 0 3 from the US.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,800
 So in order to prevent a real fork from happening, I strongly believe that I need to take, as

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,160
 much center space, as possible.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,760
 E4.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,280
 E5.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,800
 Still theory.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,600
 Now queen H4 ends my video, since it attacks my E-pawn, my F-pawn, and my H-pawn.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,920
 Therefore, knight F3.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,680
 Knights are good, because even though they attack a lot of squares, their attack range

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,720
 is very limited to their positions.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,520
 F6.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,080
 That blunders a pawn, but if I take it, there is a chance that he takes back with his pawn,

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:02,080
 which blunders a rook to queen H5, but that move actually ends my video, so I cannot play

16
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,840
 it, which means I'll be losing a knight, instead of him losing a rook.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,720
 Therefore, D4.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,200
 Knight C6.

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
 Yes.

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,000
 Another knight move, which is definitely good for the video.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,880
 And if you take a look at the board, there is absolutely no way for him to end my video

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,520
 right now.

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,160
 And he resigned.

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,080
 Mission accomplished, but since the video is so short, I think I'll take this chance

25
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,320
 to answer some of your comments in my videos.

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,920
 I am so used to brilliant moves, I find them easily now.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,840
 Yeah you wish.

28
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,040
 Nice chopsticks man.

29
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,120
 Nice avatar man.

30
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,000
 Hey, maybe if you ply your challenges against 1000s, you get better results.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,800
 That is absolutely correct, therefore I decided that I should play against the 100s, so that

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,800
 they become unpredictably hard.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:20,320
