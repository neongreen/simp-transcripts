1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
 If your king is in check and can't move out of check?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,560
 Wait. Not only I have to be

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,440
 in check, I also have to

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,160
 can't move out of check?

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,280
 Ha! What kind of easy challenge is this?

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,440
 There is no way I'm gonna lose, and since there's no way I'm gonna lose,

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,280
 there is also no need to read this part of the challenge.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,840
 Let's go. We get a 173 from the US.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,280
 E3. Not very aggressive. I got a challenge that depends on king's

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,200
 activity, and he made such a passive opening move.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,320
 E5. This is such an obvious victory for me.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,560
 Queen h5. Ah ha! Now we're talking. I was about to go king e7,

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,240
 saying that I should give him some chances to end my video.

14
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,360
 But of course, king e7 now is just blundering checkmate in 1.

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,680
 So I guess, knight c6. Let's just delay king e7 for one move.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,160
 Well unless he blunders his queen to end my video.

17
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,800
 Bishop c4. Well, I guess we'll have to delay the move for another move.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,560
 g6. It's fine guys, for most of the time,

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
 people will just gonna play queen f3, which means I'll have to delay it for

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,680
 one more move, and then I'll play it.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:37,760
 Did I just lose to that challenge? Oh well. I mean the video is still so

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,840
 short. I'll answer some comments instead.

23
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,240
 Your mom is in the thumbnail. No you. You did argue with my money though

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,160
 last year. Well, to be honest I did argue with a lot

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,000
 of donations ideas, due to them being things like exposing

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,440
 my face, exposing my main account, or build a

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,680
 freaking chess engine. So maybe yeah, your money might be in one

28
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,360
 of those times.

29
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,160
 Quack.

30
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,720
 UHHH what is he drawing?

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,840
 I think I tried to draw a bishop in that video,

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
 and I think it looks fine.

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:28,800
