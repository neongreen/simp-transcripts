00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 I'm better than my viewers, so many Edwards. Yeah. That looks fun.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:11,200
 Welcome to episode 10 of I'm better than my viewers, and the challenger this time is a guy

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:18,320
 called Pythag, with the Pythagorean theorem formula comes after, and a very angry cat profile picture.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,720
 But anyway, since the position is very tricky, I actually let him choose which side to play,

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,920
 and he chose, the white pieces. Bishop f5, and then he lost that advantage on move 1.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:40,160
 But anyway, he's obviously threatening bishop g6 checkmate in 1, therefore, c5 is kinda forced.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,400
 I mean even though Stockfish thinks the position is good for me right now,

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:53,760
 this is still very tricky to play. B4. I'll take this Edward. Knight c2. Let's give a check.

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:03,200
 I mean there can't be anything wrong just by giving a check right? King f2. B6. G4. Very aggressive.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:14,000
 Queen c6. Knight g3. Ok. Here we go. King takes the second Edward. 2 down, 4 to go.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,560
 Knight d4. Ah ha. Very tricky. He's trying to trick me to take his knight, and then he can go

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,960
 b5 discovered check with a double attack on my queen, which means I'll be losing my woman. So I

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:37,520
 guess, queen a4. B takes e5. I'll take this bishop, that bishop has been a real asshole from the very

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:45,280
 beginning of the game. Bishop g6, I have no idea what that move does. Let's take this pawn as well,

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,720
 I guess Stockfish has been really angry with me in the recent moves because I keep ignoring taking

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:58,640
 this knight in the very middle of the board. Knight gfi check. Ok. Now things get serious.

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,560
 Taking his knight with my queen obviously doesn't seem to be a good idea. King f6 is also way too

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,040
 dank, king f8 there is e7 king g8 knight e6 knight d8 and then there is no way for me to prevent this

19
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:18,720
 Edward from changing his gender. So I guess. King d8. Man I don't even know if that was a good idea,

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,360
 but generally speaking moving the king closer to the other pieces should be a less risky move.

21
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:31,680
 e7 check. King c7 is blundering a royal fork, therefore, king d7 is kinda forced.

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,160
 And Edward changes gender. And by the way, that was the first wife that the white king has ever

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,720
 had in this game, but sadly, that doesn't last long. I mean I never like to ruin other people's

24
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:52,240
 family, but that situation gave me no other choices. Bishop avenges the woman. King takes.

25
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:59,920
 Knight b5. Ah ha, this guy is trying to trick me to take his knight, and then there is knight d6

26
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:08,400
 check with a royal fork on my queen. Man, this guy is truly dangerous. a5, doesn't matter,

27
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:16,160
 I'll push that pawn all the way to the end. g5. Bishop e5. Since he's been trying to trick me to

28
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,280
 blunder my queen twice in this game, let's see if he can see that by moving my bishop,

29
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,840
 I'm actually attacking his knight because my bishop is now defending the royal fork.

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:36,000
 And he did. But still, that doesn't change the situation. Bishop d4 Edward d4 queen c6 king f3

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,360
 queen g6 king f4 a4 e5 a3 d5 a2 knight d6 king f8 e6 and he changes gender e4 new woman f1 check

32
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,720
 king e5 queen g7, a beautiful checkmate with the king in the middle of his other pieces.

33
00:03:50,720 --> 00:04:03,840
 I'm better than my viewers.

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,440
