 100 rated chess, but you're a beginner's chess engine, if you can take a piece, not pawn, you must take a piece, not pawn, and you never learned how to checkmate, so you can only win that way by doing what you already know how to do.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 Taking a piece.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Not pawn.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Such a complicated way to explain a simple challenge.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 But anyway, we get an exact 100 rated guy from the United Kingdom.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 With premium membership.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 E4.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 E5.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 To be fair, this challenge is actually one of the easier ones, so I guess we're gonna have a good time here.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 Knight f3.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Knight f6.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Knight takes e5.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 Ah ha. Now I can take this pawn, but since the challenge said not pawn, knight c6 instead.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Knight back.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Coward. I still don't want to take this pawn because of queen e2 queen e7 and I'll probably have to trade my queen, so I guess, d6.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 In case you're wondering why I'm so against trading queens, it's because I'm playing against a 100 rated player, and in this rating area, you just let them blunder their own queen.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 c3.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Bishop g4.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Probably I'll have to trade my bishop off next move, but who knows, maybe he'll move his knight to give me his queen instead.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Of course that doesn't happen.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Taking a piece, is forced.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Letting his queen goes here is pretty dangerous, but the riskier he plays, the more chance he'll blunder his queen.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Yeah. Like that.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 King takes f7 is forced.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Bishop check. I'll go back.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 d3.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 I'll take this pawn.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Okay so here's the problem. Even though I'm leaving a gigantic amount of material, the challenge also forbids me from checkmating his king, so if he never resigns, maybe I'll be losing on time.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 e5.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 I want to take that pawn, but sadly, taking a piece is forced.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 d4.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 d takes d takes knight takes, I mean opening up the queen is very dangerous, but even if he plays something like knight d2 forcing my queen to take, I still can just use my knight and take this bishop instead.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 Bishop f4.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 That blunders a bishop. Now he should be able to see, that since I'm obviously attacking this pawn, a move like knight d2 forcing knight takes bishop takes queen takes king takes and I'm losing a queen is just blundering this pawn.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 Right?

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 It's fine. Knight takes is kinda forced, I mean who knows, maybe he won't recapture.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 And he did.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 Again, not a paid actor.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Knight e4 bishop takes knight takes rook takes queen takes king takes, and he still hasn't resigned.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Okay fine I'll take all the pawns. Fast forward. And in this very position, he still doesn't resign.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 But he abandoned the game.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Mission, accomplished.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:27,000
