00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 100 rated chess, but you have tunnel vision, you may only move the pieces, or pawns, that are

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
 currently within a 3 tile range from what your opponent just moved. You know, this sounds pretty

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,680
 impossible, but actually, I think I have a small trick. We get a 2 1 6 from Costa Rica, and since

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,800
 I have to make the first move, let's just ignore the challenge for now, because it wouldn't be fair

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:37,120
 if I have to end my video at move 1. E4. E5. Aha, now I can only move a piece, or pawn, that is

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:47,520
 within 3 square from this guy, so let's see. 1, 2, 3. F4. Some people may say that counting like this

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,200
 is cheating and it makes the challenge way much easier, but you know, the guy who gave the challenge

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,040
 didn't say anything about how I'm supposed to count the squares, so I will take full advantage of

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:09,440
 that. And I'm not a coward. F5. I'll take that pawn, no need to count there. E takes F4. Aha,

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:20,640
 now queen H5 is very strong, and let's see. 1, 2, 3, queen H5. Again, I'm absolutely not cheating at all.

11
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:31,600
 G6. F takes G6. Again, no need to count that. H takes G6. That blunders a rook. I mean a move like

12
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,360
 B6 will immediately end my video, but since my queen is attacking very hard over here,

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,000
 no one can get their bishop on the other side of the board. Right?

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,640
 Of course, that move cuts my queen away from seeing the H4 square, which helps him play

15
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,600
 queen H4 next, and even though I can go queen E5 check, queen E7 will force me to trade queens,

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,440
 and after bishop takes E7, I actually have no pieces or pawns that are 3 squares away from

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,240
 his bishop, which means I'll have to end the video. So I guess, queen H7. This move threatens

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:15,360
 to take his pawn with a big check, so I hope that he will get scared and play something like queen

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:24,720
 F6 instead of queen H4. Or he can just don't get scared and also don't go queen H4. But anyway.

20
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:36,640
 1, 2, 3, queen takes G6. Man, this challenge is so easy. King E7 is forced, queen takes G4,

21
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,520
 the plan is just to keep my queen in the middle of the board, so that she can have an optimal

22
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:53,120
 distance from all of his pieces. D6. Aha. 1, 2, and 3. Queen H4, wait wait wait. I almost went

23
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,440
 queen H4, which is a check, and then after king back to E8, I actually have no pieces or pawns

24
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,160
 that are 3 square close to his king, which means I will be ending my own video. So I guess, queen

25
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:12,240
 takes F4. I don't really want to block my bishop's way, but at least this will keep my queen in the

26
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,400
 center, and since I didn't check him, there is no reason to play a move like king E8. Right?

27
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:32,800
 1, 2, no. 1, 2, no. And the worst thing is, Stockfish actually said, "Excellent".
