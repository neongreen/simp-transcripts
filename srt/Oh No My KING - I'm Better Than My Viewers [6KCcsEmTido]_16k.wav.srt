1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
 I'm better than my viewers?

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,000
 You play as white.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,280
 Let's go.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,940
 Welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers, and the challenger this time is

5
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,240
 a guy called Ragdoll Kitten, and as you can see, he is very high rated, so maybe after

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,480
 all that time, someone can finally be better than me.

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,000
 No chance by the way.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,420
 I'll take this pawn, I mean b1 changing gender e6 queen f5 is obviously too dangerous, so

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,560
 there is no way I'm not taking that pawn.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,400
 d6 check.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,360
 I'll go back, and even though my king is in the center of the board, I actually think

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,000
 that he is quite safe.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,040
 Each pawn changes gender.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:49,320
 The only way the queen can go out is to take the pawn on f5, therefore, knight g3.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,560
 Attacking the woman, defending the pawn, this horsey is the best.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,880
 Queen h3.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,080
 Ah ha.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,440
 Finally, it is my time to attack.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,920
 b7, I mean the attack is quite useless as I'll only win a piece that is already trapped

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,360
 in the first place.

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
 But still, it is progress.

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,520
 Knight b7 a b7 bishop b7.

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,080
 c6, I mean even though he is 2100 rated, if he can just ignore that bishop for one move

24
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,520
 and allow me to have a queen so that our game can be a little bit more balanced, that will

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,640
 be very convenient.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,800
 Yeah no way that can ever happen.

27
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,400
 g7, ok I know that was a very risky move as it may open up the way for his queen to get

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,840
 active, but I'm not sure if spending a lot of moves just to get a queen active is even

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,320
 a good decision or not, so let's just see how things are gonna go.

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
 Rook h7.

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,320
 Ah ha, he is allowing me to have a wife, but as a real gentleman, I don't want to see my

32
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,560
 wife dying immediately after we've just got married.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,600
 Therefore, I'll change this guy to a rook.

34
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,920
 King takes.

35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,840
 Knight c3.

36
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
 Knight e7.

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,320
 Ah ha!

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,960
 It's time to run.

39
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,040
 Come at me baby.

40
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,040
 Bishop takes f5 check, blocking with a knight sounds like what a coward is gonna do, therefore,

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,320
 king c4.

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,560
 Bishop c2, that move's sole purpose is to prevent my king from going back to b3, which

43
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,760
 is to say, very aggressive.

44
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,760
 Rook c1.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,880
 d5 check.

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,440
 He's obviously provoking knight takes knight takes king takes queen e6 check and my king

47
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,640
 is dead.

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
 Therefore, king b4.

49
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,520
 a5 check.

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,560
 Ah ha, now the French move is possible, but as we can see, that is obviously a bad move

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,140
 as it not only allows knight c6 check but also opens up his rook.

52
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,520
 So I guess, king a3.

53
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,280
 Once again, all poisson, is not forced.

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,600
 Bishop b1.

55
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,200
 Knight a2 bishop a2 king a2.

56
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,000
 And in this very position, I realized that all I have is just a rook, a knight and once

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,280
 again, a lot of useless same color bishops, so after my rook dies, there is no way I can

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,300
 checkmate his king because again, I don't know how to checkmate with bishop and knight.

59
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,800
 So I offered a draw, he accepted it, game drawn by agreement.

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,000
 Which is to say, I'm better than my viewers.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:35,900
