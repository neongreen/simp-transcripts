00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 100 rated chess, but your hands are coated in butter, every third move must be a mouse slip.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,400
 Wet and slippery. We get a 189 from the Philippines.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,440
 E4. First move is not a slippery move, and I mean what can be wet when we've just started by the way.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,960
 D5. I'll take that pawn.

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:29,120
 Queen takes. Ah ha. Now things get wet. The most popular next move is knight c3 attacking the

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:36,640
 queen, but sadly, oopsie. As a wise man once said, knight on the rim is mouse slipped.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:44,400
 Queen e5 check. Bishop e2. I have no idea how to make a mouse slip if I have to do it when

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:52,320
 he gives a check to be honest. Queen back to d5 again. Knight f3. Expecting knight back to e5

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:00,640
 which blunders a woman. Didn't happen. I want to play b3 trying to fianchetto my bishop, but sadly,

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:09,840
 mouse slipped. E4. Very aggressive. C4. Danger levels, and since his e-pawn has left the e5

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,120
 square, I do believe he'll move his queen back to that square. I have too much experience against

12
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:24,320
 these 100 rated guys. That blunders a woman. He'll resign soon, I think we can already prepare

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:33,680
 ourselves for a mission accomplished. F6. Ah ha. I want to go bishop h5 g6 knight g6 hg6 going for

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,800
 a quick attack at his king. But sadly, mouse slipped. And that was 100% a mouse slip. I'm

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,800
 definitely not baiting him to take my knight which blunders a rook to queen h5 queen e5 queen h8.

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:58,560
 Trust. F takes e5. He gives me no other choices. G6. Queen takes e5 check. And I've just realized

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,720
 that the next move has to be a mouse slip, so I actually cannot take his rook. Ha. Nevermind.

18
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:11,200
 Mission accomplished.

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:24,000
