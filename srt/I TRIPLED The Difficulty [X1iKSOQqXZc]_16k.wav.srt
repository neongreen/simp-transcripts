00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 100 rated chess, but every time your pawn steps on a square, you gain a piece step.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,960
 Your pieces can only move by consuming a piece step.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,440
 One piece step obviously sounds way too easy, so let's just make it.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,520
 3.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,800
 Now that's some real challenges.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,600
 E4.

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,720
 My first move obviously has to be a pawn move, therefore, E5, I mean Qh5 d6 Qxf7+.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,920
 Qh7+ will force me to move my king before I can stack up 3 piece steps, which makes

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,760
 me a fool for ending my own video.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,840
 But to be honest, the chance that this entire thing can happen is even smaller than the

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,080
 chance that a random girl will show up and ask for your phone number.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,520
 F3.

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,200
 Not very aggressive.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,760
 F5.

15
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,440
 D3.

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,680
 D5.

17
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,560
 And with that, we have officially reached 3 piece steps, which is enough for 1 piece

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,840
 move, but let's just try to stack up some more before that.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,640
 C4.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,240
 Dxc4.

21
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,000
 Maybe this is a bad decision because it can open up the queen file, which costs me 3 steps,

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,400
 but if I had pushed my pawn instead, that will close the position down, which will be

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,400
 very difficult to make pawn moves to tackle the challenge.

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,800
 Qa4 check.

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,240
 Bd7 is best, but of course, c6.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,160
 B4.

27
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,480
 Very aggressive.

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:38,840
 That blunders a rook to Qd4 Qxa1, but since I only have 5 steps, that is only enough for

29
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,480
 1 piece move.

30
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,040
 Therefore, Exd3.

31
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
 H4.

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,000
 I'm very suspicious that this guy is also trying to do some crazy challenges with his

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,640
 pawns.

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,840
 Qd4.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
 Qb3.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,760
 Aha, that still blunders a rook, but I think that he thinks that he can actually trap my

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,800
 queen with Bb2.

38
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,040
 Therefore, Bxb4.

39
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,480
 Maybe this is an unnecessary risk, but I want to take as many pawns away as possible, and

40
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:15,880
 I strongly believe that he won't take my bishop because he thinks that I can take his rook

41
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,360
 and then get away with Qa2.

42
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
 Just like a paid actor.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,000
 D5, this game is going unbelievably well for me.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Bxd3.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 E4.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Fxe4.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 Fxe4.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 A3.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,920
 Spending 3 steps to retreat my bishop is not very appealing.

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,520
 Therefore, Exd3.

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,560
 I mean there is also a chance that he won't take my bishop for some very unknown reasons.

52
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
 Right?

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,120
 Sadly he's not a paid actor.

54
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
 H5.

55
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,880
 Man, I'm literally almost out of pawn moves.

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,640
 Nf3.

57
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,040
 Bg4.

58
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,600
 Rook e1 will force a piece move, but since he's been blundering this rook for 9 moves,

59
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,920
 and I've never seen anyone blundering the same thing for 10 moves straight, he should be

60
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,760
 moving his rook.

61
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,040
 Right?

62
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,320
 Now.

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,600
 Exactly.

64
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,840
 B6.

65
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,480
 Dude, I'm running out of pawns.

66
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,400
 Maybe changing from 1 to 3 is just a little bit too much testosterone.

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
 Rook b5.

68
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,600
 Alright, change of plan.

69
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,160
 Queen f2 bc5 queen e2 checkmate.

70
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,320
 Mission is failed, but at least I won.

71
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:52,040
