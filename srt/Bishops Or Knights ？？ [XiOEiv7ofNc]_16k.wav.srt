00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
 I'm better than my viewers, again caught, but I'm very sorry, this name was taken by another guy before, so I have to delete this part.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:18,600
 But anyway, gays and gentlemen and ladies, welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers, and the viewer this time is a guy called Rick Astley.

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,000
 It's like there are 200 Rick Astley's in my server.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,600
 As soon as I invited him into the game, he said,

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,200
 "Ha ha, you're Megan-less."

6
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,500
 "This guy is so dead."

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,200
 "Bishop Fd3."

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,200
 "Developing a bishop can not be a bad idea."

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,500
 Rook e8 check.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,900
 King f1.

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,000
 Knight ce6.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 "Ah ha, that blunders a pawn."

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,900
 Bishop e5 knight b5 bishop c6.

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,300
 And then he said,

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,000
 "That was a good sack."

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,700
 "No sir, that was a normal tactic called, overloading."

17
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,800
 Rook b8.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,400
 I'll take this knight.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
 Knight b4.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,800
 Alright, this time it is truly a sacrifice.

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:09,300
 Rook a5 knight a5 bishop c5 knight takes bishop takes king g8 rook a5.

22
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,300
 I sacrificed a rook for a knight and 2 pawns.

23
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,400
 Knight takes c2.

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,900
 I'll take with rook.

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,800
 Knight a8.

26
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,400
 Bishop a7.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,300
 Rook d8.

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:25,300
 "Ah ha, he wants to create a counterattack on my king."

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,700
 And you know what?

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,100
 Bishop a2.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,800
 "Come at me baby."

32
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,900
 Coward.

33
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,300
 I'll take it.

34
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,000
 Rook takes.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Bishop takes g5.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,300
 Again with the overloading tactic.

37
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,900
 Knight takes bishop takes rook h7 bishop g5.

38
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,200
 I mean even though I'm having a gigantic positional advantage right now,

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,900
 if he can somehow trade down all of my rooks,

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,600
 I still cannot checkmate him with only bishops.

41
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,400
 Nevermind.

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,000
 That blunders a rook.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Knight g4.

44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,600
 Bishop d4.

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,400
 Controlling all of the dark squares near his king.

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,500
 Knight e5.

47
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,300
 "Ah ha, he's obviously baiting me to take his knight which blunders knight e3 forking my king and my rook."

48
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:18,000
 And even though normally I would have done that because it simplifies the position and also creates an open file for my rook,

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,600
 I don't want to let a guy who said that I'm maidenless forks me.

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,200
 So I guess, I'll take this knight.

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,300
 King g7.

52
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,800
 And since there is an extremely easy to see checkmate in 9 in this position,

53
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,100
 fast forward.

54
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,500
 Rook g8.

55
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,900
 Checkmate.

56
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,700
 Ha! Even though I'm maidenless,

57
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,000
 I'm better than my viewers.

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:54,800
