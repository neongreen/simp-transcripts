00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
 I'm better than my viewers, except this time the guy who suggests the position didn't say anything,

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:13,680
 he just leaves a picture, and then silently walks away. Very cool. Welcome to episode 20 of I'm

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:19,680
 better than my viewers, and the challenger this time is a guy called ink on toast. I'll check

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,280
 first. You know what they say, a check can never be a bad move, unless when a check can be a bad

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:35,360
 move. Knight d takes c6. d6, a double attack also cannot be a bad move. Rook d d5. I'll take it.

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,400
 Rook takes. I'll take this woman, it's pretty annoying that he still has a big harem after I've

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,080
 taken away one member but I don't even have a wife, but you know, at least I have some guys

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:58,640
 waiting to change their gender for me. Queen takes c7. Bishop f4. Queen e7. Bishop g5, alright I can

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
 see that there will be some chess elites jump in and say "why did you move your bishop back and

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,440
 forth like an absolute 100 rated disliked unsubbed you trash youtuber". I mean you are right that I

11
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:14,960
 shouldn't have done that, but I realized my mistake after bishop f4, so I decided to fix

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,960
 my mistake by undoing the bad move, because you know what they say, human beings make mistakes

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,840
 all the time, so when you do make a mistake, just press ctrl z. Queen back to c7. Ha, you see,

14
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,280
 my opponent also agrees to help me fix my mistake. King f2, making room for a bishop to come to f3.

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,640
 Knight takes d4. In case you don't know, we both can actually see the stockfish evaluation bar on

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,480
 the left of the board, and when he saw that stockfish didn't like that move, he said "whoops".

17
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:56,880
 And then I felt bad for him, so I replied, can't help you about that man, but in fact,

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,520
 I actually can help him because classroom allows me to just go back one move and continue playing

19
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,240
 from there and no viewer is gonna know anything about it. But of course, there is no reason to

20
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,720
 let him know about that. Bishop gf3, I mean if he can just take this bishop now and blunder his

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:20,000
 queen instead of his rook, that will be very convenient. Well, I think we can all agree that

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,720
 sometimes things can still be convenient without a paid actor. Bishop takes king c8 bishop d5 queen

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,920
 d3 bishop e6 queen b6 bishop e3 queen e3 that blunders a woman another wants queen d5 e7 queen

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,840
 f5 king g1 queen h5 bishop h5 knight c4 rook g7. I'm sacrificing my bishop here, and even though

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,040
 it should have been oh no my bishop, we can see that he really likes to say whoops, so of course

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:56,080
 I changed it to whoops my bishop. Knight takes bishop. e8 promotes to a rook. Checkmate. I'm

27
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:09,680
 better than my viewers.

28
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,120
