 100 rated chess, but your pieces are lazy. They will refuse to move unless they are in direct view

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,320
 of their king. I think I've done something a bit similar to this before, but since I don't remember

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,760
 it, plus the fact that there is no way that video was a success, it is time for a retry. We get a 125

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,720
 from Saudi Arabia. E4. I mean I had to move one of the three pawns, so there was nothing much to

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:38,400
 think about. G6. Not very aggressive. Okay. Here we go. Bishop c4. The plan is simple. Bishop c4,

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,400
 queen f3 threatening mate, he blunders checkmate, king e2 because I cannot move my queen to checkmate

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,440
 when the king doesn't see her, he blunders checkmate for the second time in a row, queen f7

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:58,800
 mission accomplished. Ha! Exactly as planned. Queen f3. Okay now d5 will absolutely destroy

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,360
 this video because it will stop the checkmate and win my bishop at the same time as I cannot

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,320
 retreat it outside of the king's vision, but since that move is just blundering a pawn,

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:18,480
 there is no way he's playing it. Right? Alright. Change of plan. King f1. The bishop is dead,

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:27,520
 so the new plan is knight h3 knight g5 also going for the f7 pawn. Rest in peace Frank. Knight h3.

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,400
 I mean you guys may say that I should have played g4 before knight h3 to avoid it being

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,720
 taken immediately by the bishop, but since he already made it clear that he wants to

15
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:44,560
 fianchetto his bishop, he's not just gonna take it right now. Right? Absolutely.

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,040
 g3. The king needs to give the order to his horsey, and in no world do you take this pawn

17
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,760
 right now and then win my queen next move just because I cannot move her due to the rules.

18
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:08,240
 No world, including this one. Yeah. No doubt. King g2. One down, two to go.

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,400
 f5. Ah ha, he's obviously preparing to go bishop take c4 skewering my royal couple,

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
 and since I don't really want to waste a move moving my queen,

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,320
 knight g5. I mean if he still insists on skewering me, my knight actually cannot take back due to

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,040
 the rules, but he doesn't know about that, and there is a bigger chance that he will just take

23
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,280
 this pawn with his pawn, queen f7 will become possible, so I believe that this is a worthy risk.

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,840
 Very convenient. Queen f7 check. And I've just realized,

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,760
 that now none of these pieces can move because the king doesn't see them anymore.

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:58,160
 Wow. Now what? I mean I can consider getting my rook in, but queen e8 is just winning my

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,880
 queen for free, and there is no way my rook can make any progress before that happens.

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:12,480
 Ah ha! I think I've got an amazing idea. F*** the challenge, queen e6 king e8 queen f7 king d7

29
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,840
 queen e8 king e8 queen f7 king d7 draw by repetition. And since I ended the video myself,

30
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,480
 there is no what the f*** today.
