1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
 100 rated chess, but you are a noob, you cannot move pieces.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,520
 And pawns, until your opponent has shown you how that material moves.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,600
 Man, it's pretty creepy that he used pieces here, but then used material after,

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,280
 it's like he's already known that I will add in pawns into the challenge.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,080
 But anyway, we got a 140 from the US, and it's pretty lucky that we got the black pieces,

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,760
 because I might have to end the video immediately if we've got the white pieces.

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,600
 A little piece moved forward 2 squares.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,600
 Ah ha, as a new player, I don't know how any of these weird shape things move,

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,720
 but since he's just shown me that these little things standing in front can move forward 2

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,800
 squares, I'll do the same thing. Again, I absolutely don't know how to play this game,

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,920
 but I will prove to you guys that a new player can absolutely win their first ever chess game,

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,400
 even when they only learn from their own opponent.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,600
 The spiky shaped thing went diagonally.

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,520
 Ah ha, so normally a real chess player will go knight c6 here to defend their pawn,

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,800
 but since I don't know how these horse-like pieces move,

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,280
 I also don't know that the queen can go horizontally. I have to go for,

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,560
 the spiky shaped thing 2 squares diagonally.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,320
 Again, this is not to defend the pawn because I didn't know the queen can go horizontally,

19
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,160
 but also not to defend scholar's mate, it's just a random move from a very chess beginner.

20
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,760
 Horsie piece forward. And just like that, I now know how to move.

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,080
 My horsie. I mean if he can just blunder a horsie right now to make my game a bit easier

22
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,720
 as all of my moves are depending on his decisions. That will be very convenient.

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,720
 Well. Very convenient.

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,440
 I'll take it. Well I mean if he pushes this pawn right now,

25
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,160
 I won't be able to retreat my knight because he hasn't taught me that this piece can also go

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,160
 backward. But all I can do is just hope that he won't play like that.

27
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,560
 The thin and tall piece goes diagonally.

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,000
 Yeah, now I know that my thin and tall guy can also go diagonally,

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,120
 but before we do that, let's take it for free.

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,960
 Small guy in front 1 square forward. That blunders the guy with 3 horns in the corner.

31
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,840
 Maybe that was a bad decision because I haven't known how the guys with 3 horns move yet,

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,960
 but since he still has 1 more on the other side, I guess I don't have to worry about that.

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,640
 Tall and thin guy 1 square to the right.

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,560
 Ah ha, now the best continuation is obviously queen b1 queen d1 queen d1 king d1 knight b2,

35
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
 but since I don't know that my queen can go horizontally,

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,480
 poor c piece takes the tall and thin.

37
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,640
 Resignation.

38
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,640
 And with this game, I just want to say, that even the newest chess player can literally win their

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,160
 very first chess game ever without knowing anything at all even about how the pieces move.

40
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,400
 So if you cannot do it. Well.

41
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,600
 You s-

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:24,080
