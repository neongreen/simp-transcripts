1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
 So I was 1599 rapid rated in chess.com.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,480
 There comes the question.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,360
 How can I get to 1600?

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,120
 I mean queuing into a game is too much of a risk.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,480
 So here is what I did.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,040
 I opened the live chess settings, and changed the outgoing range to -25 to +400.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,960
 Then I queued for a match.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,800
 We got d4,

9
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,040
 d5,

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,400
 bishop f4.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
 And I offered a draw.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
 Mouse slipped.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:41,160
 Well of course, I didn't mouse slipped into a London system, just wanted the free draw.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,080
 At first, he declined the draw so fast that he couldn't read my chat.

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,100
 But then the nice guy offered back the draw.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,880
 And since his elo was way higher than mine, a draw is a +1 for me.
