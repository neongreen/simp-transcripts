00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 I'm gooder than my viewers. Anka. Changing the series name shall not be forgiven.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,160
 Maybe a permaban. Morning everyone, welcome to another my viewers suck video,

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,720
 and today's viewers is a guy called Dark Neutrino. Before the game begins, he asked me to wait for

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,720
 him for a few minutes, so I used that time to think about the position. He takes F5 is a very

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,880
 arousing move, but as my king is very exposed and unsafe, opening up this queen may not be a very

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:39,520
 good idea. So I guess, I'll attack the other side instead. Bishop takes. The original plan was queen

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:48,320
 takes rook C2. But if bishop takes, I guess I have no other choice but to defend. D takes E4.

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:57,840
 Alright. I'm not a coward. But king F1. Knight G4. Too dangerous, need to take.

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:06,640
 Pawn takes. Rook C2 doesn't make any sense anymore, rook A6 instead. Looks really strong,

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,720
 but to be honest I don't think it can help much in such a desperate situation.

11
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,200
 Rook check. King G2. My king is actually pretty safe on G2 as he doesn't have a light square

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,880
 bishop, but I also struggle to find a real way to make progress with such material imbalance.

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:34,320
 Rook H7. Must capture. Rook takes. I really want to play D4 aiming to open up my queen's attack,

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,760
 but D4 E D4 E D4 there is queen H2 a very easy to see checkmate in 6, and even if I go rook C6

15
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:49,520
 first, D4 E D4 E D4 there is still E3 discovered check with a double attack on my queen and also

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,280
 a very easy to see checkmate in 5. Therefore even though this may look like a very dumb decision,

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,080
 I have to do it. This queen is just too dangerous at the moment, I'll make a queen trade to close

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:11,600
 down the position. Queen takes pawn takes. Rook H3. Aha. This capture benefits, but if you really

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,440
 think about it, this rook actually doesn't do any harm to my position. I'll ignore it for now.

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:28,720
 G3. Aha. Now that really blunders a rook. The blunders are coming in. Absolutely. That blunders

21
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:36,960
 a horsey. And just like that, Stockfish thinks this is a draw. King forward. Free bishop.

22
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,440
 King forward again. Knight G1. One attacker, one defender. Nothing to worry.

23
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:56,000
 King back. Rook E5. My rook will help in the defend. Queen H4. He's threatening queen H2,

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,880
 but in fact, that blunders a woman. His queen is trapped.

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,360
 Aha. This is such a perfect chance for me to try out. A bishop and knight checkmate.

26
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:18,320
 And 30 moves later, king F2 stalemate. In my defend, bishop and knight checkmate is very

27
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,280
 difficult, I didn't even know that I should have cornered his king in the dark corners instead of

28
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:39,280
 a light one, it's not my fault. And at the end of the day, I'm better than my viewers.

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,280
