00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
 I'm better than no. It was supposed to be. My viewers. Let's go. Welcome to episode 21 of I'm

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,000
 better than my viewers. Today's challenger is a guy called Vladivostok. And as you can see right

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,080
 there, he is very proud to brag about his ratings being over 2000 points. F5. I'll take it. So my

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,640
 plan should be to take advantage of the open king on this side of the board and try to promote a

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,520
 pawn for an early checkmate, because there is no way in hell I can break through the center with

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:39,040
 all of these materials inside. D6. Ah ha, he's trying to kick my knight away so that he can go

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,800
 knight C6 forking my queen and rook, and even though queen B6 looks fine, I don't really want

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,840
 to move my queen to the bad side of the board. Therefore, H3. I'm sorry little horsey, your

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:01,200
 sacrifice will never be forgotten. He's dead. Queen takes. Knight takes F5. H2. I'm calculating

10
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,560
 knight takes E7 oh no my woman rook G1 check bishop G1 is forced H pawn changes gender with

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,200
 a checkmate, but since this guy is 2000 rated, there is no way that can ever happen. Right?

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:24,080
 No doubt. Queen E6, let's save the maiden first. Rook D5. H4. I mean he put his knight there a

13
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,280
 few moves ago to block my rook from infiltrating, so if he can just forget about that and move it

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,560
 out of the way right now, that will be very convenient. Of course that doesn't happen.

15
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,360
 Queen takes F5, the plan is bishop F5 rook G3 bishop G3 I get a new woman king F2 and I also

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,400
 get a new queen. I'm in his woman, and to be honest, that plan looks like it is very likely

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:57,600
 to happen. I'm maidenless. Rook takes G3, I mean he can also choose not to take my rook and play

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,720
 something like D4 to run his king away, but I think I can win his queen regardless of what he

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:12,960
 wants to do. Bishop takes D7 check. And then 10 seconds later, he said. Oh. Well who cares

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:18,160
 Rook E6 check. So normally I would have taken this bishop immediately without thinking, but since

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,600
 this time I'm playing against a 2000 rated opponent, there is no way he is blundering his bishop for

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:31,040
 absolutely free. Therefore, I'll play it safe. Well but I mean if he wants to sacrifice his rook next,

23
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,160
 I'm pretty sure I'll take it. Of course it doesn't happen. He's offering a draw by repetition,

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,360
 but I'll refuse for now. Declining a draw offer is actually a big deal to a YouTuber,

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,920
 because if somehow I lose this game after declining that draw, I can't imagine what

26
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,880
 horrible thing people are gonna say in the comment section. Bishop takes G3. I can make a queen now,

27
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,960
 but I guess I'll take this first. You know what they say, a real man never rushes to get a new

28
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:11,760
 wife. Wait. I actually think that's wrong. But anyway. D4. H-pawn stonelize check. King D2 rook

29
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,000
 takes D1 king takes D1 G2 C5 very aggressive rook B2 and instead of letting me finish the game,

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,840
 in this very position, my opponent resigned. Therefore, I'm better than my viewers.

31
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,680
