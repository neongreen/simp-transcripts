00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but you are frisk, every move must be filled with determination.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,560
 Every piece or pawn you capture must be a desperado or a lower value trade.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:14,960
 For those of you guys who don't know this is an undertale reference,

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,160
 and if you don't know what undertale is, me neither.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,360
 E4. E5. I don't think my opponent can force me to make a desperado,

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,160
 so we only need to care about the lower value trades.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:38,800
 Knight H3. D5. Queen F3. Aha! Now D takes E4 should be the best move,

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,120
 but that only results in an equal trade, which is not allowed by the rules, bishop C5 instead.

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:54,160
 Knight G5. Very aggressive. That blunders a horsey, but a blunder is not a lower value trade,

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,200
 therefore, knight F6. I mean if he takes my knight right now, I actually also cannot take his queen

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:07,280
 back because that is also not a lower value trade, but who plays like that anyway. Right?

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:16,480
 No doubt. I cannot take that pawn back because that is an equal trade. C6.

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:28,160
 Bishop C4. Castle. D takes C6. Aha! Knight takes C6. That was 2 pawns for 1,

14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,520
 so I believe that trade obeys the rules, but if you disagree with me and want to end the video

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:43,120
 here. F*** you. Knight takes F7. I have to take that. Bishop takes. If I take his bishop now,

16
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:48,800
 it's going to be an equal trade of a rook and pawn for 2 pieces, which is against the rules,

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,360
 therefore, I have to move my king. Somehow I feel that this challenge is going very wrong very

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:05,520
 quickly. Yeah. That's why. That blunders a queen, but once again, that is against the rules,

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:14,640
 queen B6 instead. And this is not checkmate. F***! That blunders a queen,

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,720
 but I don't even want to talk about it.

21
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:28,240
 Let's hope that he thinks my bishop is magically defended by something.

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,760
 Nevermind. Knight G8 is forced. Ha! My knight is defended by my king.

23
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:56,480
