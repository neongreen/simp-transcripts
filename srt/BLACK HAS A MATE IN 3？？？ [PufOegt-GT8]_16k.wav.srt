 If I'm playing black, this is a pretty scary situation. White goes first ahead and plays

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:13,120
 rook to d8. Because apparently, that is the only legal move. Black then goes knight to h6.

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,280
 Now this guy wants to go ahead and make himself a queen. But then the white king said that he had

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,400
 too many queens in his house already. So he forced the dude to become a rook instead.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,320
 Sadge. Black then goes knight to f5, continue to take away one more white king's woman.

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
 White then goes knight to g7, wanting to make a new

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:43,680
 rook. But then black captured on e3, and white's king is now smothered checkmated after losing

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:56,560
 three of his wives. Losing queens is not good. Now please like and subscribe.
