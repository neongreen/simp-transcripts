00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
 I'm Better Than My Viewers, a literal porn structure.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,120
 Man. These names are so cringing. Ladies and gentlemen and gays,

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,160
 welcome to another episode of I'm Better Than My Viewers, the series that I have never lost

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,800
 after all these years, and the victim this time is another Anatoly Karpov.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,520
 I'll take this porn first, the plan is very simple, he takes my bishop, I give a check,

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,040
 he makes a queen, I give a check, he takes my bishop, I give a check.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,120
 Well, I mean he can also move his horsey to the rim.

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,080
 I'll give a check anyway. I mean Stockfish didn't like that move very much,

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:48,640
 but who cares about a stupid robot anyway. D takes e6. Bishop takes. Bishop blocks.

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,520
 Wow. I have no idea why, but Stockfish really hates that move. Which is good for me.

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,440
 King takes. Rook b8. Preparing to push these pawns forward.

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,520
 e1 changing gender. e6 check. As you can see, Stockfish didn't like that move very much,

13
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
 but even after thinking for 3 hours, I still couldn't understand why.

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,640
 So if you have any ideas about that blunder,

15
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,800
 please feel free to leave a comment below to brag about your amazing IQ.

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,720
 King takes. Taking this horsey is fine, but I'll give a check first.

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:36,560
 King f5. Very aggressive. Queen d5 check. Alright, now if he can just go king f6 to blunder a very

18
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,440
 simple and easy to see checkmate in 10, that will be some great content for the video.

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,080
 Of course he sees the checkmate. I'll take this horsey. Queen c1 check. Knight blocks.

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:59,280
 Knight f6. Queen e6. No worries, I already saw that coming, and now if he can just go king h7

21
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,400
 blundering queen f7 check king h6 is 4 stroke h8 check knight h7 is 4 stroke takes h7 checkmate

22
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:16,800
 in 3. That will be very convenient. King g7. Aha, for your information, both of us actually can see

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,960
 the evaluation bar on the left, which means at this point, I knew that there is a checkmate in 8.

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,200
 So of course, I took the risk, it seems like I'm just blundering a rook, but the idea is to remove

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,840
 the knight guarding the e8 square, and also make room for this pawn to go forward. Knight takes.

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,840
 Ok. Here we go. E8. And guys, I have a strong feeling that this is going to be the second

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:52,880
 dumbest decision of my entire life. But of course, I'm not a coward. And just like that, Stockfish

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:03:01,360
 said. I am f***ed. King h8. And in this position, I didn't feel like playing the game anymore.

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:10,800
 So I resigned. Therefore, I'm better than my viewers, but this guy, and only this guy, is equal to me.
