1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 If your opponent plays a move that has never been played before,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 the video ends.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 This is going to be short.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 In fact, I will be surprised if this video can last over move 5.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 But anyway, in order to do this challenge, I need an opening database.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 And this time, I'll use the Leech S database.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I actually wanted to use the chess.com one, but sadly, it requires premium membership.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 And I'm poor.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Disclaimer.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Using an opening database is not much different from using a chess engine, which is considered cheating.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 Therefore, in this video, I only used the database, after the game is already done.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Which means I didn't cheat during the game.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 That was fast.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 We get a 192 from Australia.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 So in order to extend this video, I believe that I need to play, as theoretical, as possible.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Therefore,

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 E4.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 The most played move in the book, with over 1 million games on Leech S.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But even though I have played the most famous move, there are still some chances, that the video is going to end, right now.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 E5.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Thank god.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 Let's continue.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Knight F3.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 Knight C6.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Yes.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Now as you can see, bishop B5 is the most popular move here.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 But sadly, I didn't know that during the game.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 So I played, bishop C4.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Which is also a very famous move, so there's nothing bad about it.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Right?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Knight F6.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Ah ha!

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 He's provoking me to play knight G5, the fried liver.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Now as you can see, D3 is the most popular move in this position, but once again, I didn't know that during the game.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 So I played, knight G5.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 There are a ton of theories in the fried liver, so I think that this will at least get the video a bit longer.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 [Fried liver]

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 That blunders a horsey.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 But anyway.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 What the f-

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 [Outro]
