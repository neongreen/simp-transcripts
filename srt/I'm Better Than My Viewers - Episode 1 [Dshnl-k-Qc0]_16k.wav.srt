00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
 On March 17th, 2022, a Discord member sent me this.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,800
 He wants me to play the White Pieces, but what the f*** is that king doing over there?

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:19,360
 Well, I think this can still be a legit idea. Therefore, I decided to make a new series.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,720
 I'm better than my viewers. And of course, we'll start the first episode,

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,440
 with this very position right here. My first challenger is a Discord member called W!

6
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:42,160
 First move, King B5 will put my king closer to the center. So I guess, King A5. Knight C6 check.

7
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:50,560
 Very aggressive. King A4. The plan is simple. Pull my king back. And that's all.

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:04,560
 A6. Ah ha, big chance right here. B4, King B3 coming up. There we go. King B3. Ha, your chance

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:18,400
 is over W! Now is my time to counterstrike. D5. D4. Knight F6. C3. Solidify the center.

10
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:31,120
 Queen D6. Oh no. Every time I see a woman, I see trouble coming my way. Knight F3. A5. Bishop D2.

11
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:44,720
 Surprisingly, I don't think my position is bad at all. Bishop G4. E? No. H3. Bishop takes F3.

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,240
 E takes F3. A takes B4. I really want to take this pawn now, but I guess I should pay attention

13
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,400
 to my king first. C takes B4. Fun fact, Stockfish actually suggested me to take the pawn instead.

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:09,440
 But to be honest, I think that is way too aggressive. G6. Bishop takes B5. Rook B8.

15
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,960
 I'll take this knight. That knight has been causing too much trouble for my king until now.

16
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:26,320
 Queen takes. Knight C3. Oh wait I blundered a big check. Ha. Nevermind. A3. Well at least he can

17
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:34,160
 win back his pawn. That's totally fair with me. Bishop E3. I mean the check is still possible,

18
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,040
 but with my B pawn protected by the A pawn, I don't think it's that good anymore.

19
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:48,160
 E6. Well, I guess the check was still better than that move. That blunders a woman. I solemnly swear

20
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:56,800
 that this guy is not a paid actor. E6. Wow. I'm surprised that he can remain absolutely calm and

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,280
 play a best move after blundering a queen like that. Rook E1. I guess the game is still on with

22
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:12,800
 this amount of self-control that he has. Nevermind. That blunders a rook. Knight D7. Alright,

23
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:21,520
 we had fun, now let's end this game real fast. Queen D4 E5 Queen takes D5 F6 Rook E D1 Knight B6

24
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,480
 Rook A8 check Oh no my rook knight takes A1 Queen D7 checkmate. To all of those people who have been

25
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,400
 back seating my videos. I'm better than my viewers.

26
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:34,720

27
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,220

29
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,220

30
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,440

31
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:37,940

32
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,440
 you

33
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,100

 you

40
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,240
 (upbeat music)

41
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,240
 Oh
