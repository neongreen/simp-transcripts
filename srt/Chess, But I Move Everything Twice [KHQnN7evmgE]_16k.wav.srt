00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
 100 rated chess, but on every second move, you must move the same piece, or pawn, you

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,400
 moved on the previous move.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,960
 Ok then.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,200
 We get a 1 8 e 9 from Canada.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,340
 Let's be real, this is 100% not doable.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,640
 But of course, I'll still try my best.

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,040
 And to be honest, I only hope that I won't be checkmated too early.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,040
 e 4.

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,180
 e oh wait wait wait.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,000
 If I play e 5, I won't be able to move my e pawn again next turn, because his pawn is

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,180
 already blocking the way.

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,640
 And if you really think about it, this first move is actually harder than it looks.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
 Let's see.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:54,840
 e 6 also doesn't work, because if he just pushes e 5, my e pawn is once again.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,280
 Trapped.

16
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,480
 Pushing the d pawn is just provoking bishop b 5 check, which also prevents me from moving

17
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,280
 it again.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,080
 Developing a knight also doesn't work, because since I have to move my knight again, it's

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,680
 most likely going to jump around for a while.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:20,360
 And if I push another pawn, for example, c 6, queen h 5, c 5 is forced, bishop c 4, g

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,060
 6, queen f 3, g 5 is forced, and I get checkmated by a bishop.

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,600
 So I guess.

23
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,720
 g 6.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:38,060
 I mean this is the only way to prevent queen h 5, or at least just delay it for one move.

25
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,400
 Knight f 3.

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,920
 Ah ha.

27
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,140
 He's obviously trying to prevent me from pushing g 5.

28
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,880
 But guess what?

29
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,720
 g 5 is forced.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,960
 Ha ha, you didn't stop anything, noob.

31
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,680
 Well of course that's a free pawn.

32
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,400
 This mission is getting out of control really quickly.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
 But anyway.

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,080
 That knight is actually really annoying.

35
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,640
 Therefore, e 6.

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,040
 Well, technically, if he just plays knight back to f 3, e 5 is forced, and then I'll

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,640
 lose another pawn.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,360
 What is wrong with this mission by the way?

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,400
 Queen f 3.

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,680
 That blunders a horsey.

41
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,320
 But e 5 is forced.

42
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,880
 But that's blundering a king.

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:36,680
 Are you serious?

44
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:46,640
 Well, at least I tried.
