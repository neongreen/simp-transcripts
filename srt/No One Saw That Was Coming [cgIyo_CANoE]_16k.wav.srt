00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
 100 rated chess, but it's April Fools, you have 5 turns to lose.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,700
 A short video confirmed, but since I'm actually a bit busy these days, I'll take on this one.

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,500
 We get a 148 from the Philippines.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:22,580
 I have no idea what is the connection between losing in 5 moves and April Fools, but E4.

5
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:23,580
 E5.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,780
 Alright, so in order to lose this game as fast as possible, Queen H5, some people may

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,260
 wonder why I'm playing the literally strongest move against the new players when I'm trying

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,260
 to lose.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,620
 Well, trust me, I have a plan.

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,620
 Knight F6.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,380
 Ah ha, that blunders a pawn with a check, and of course since I want to lose this game

12
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,540
 instead of winning it, I'll take that pawn.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,060
 Again, trust me, I have a plan.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,620
 Bishop E7.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,740
 There is no need to move any other pieces because this game will only last until move

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,860
 5.

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,980
 Queen G5.

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,020
 I know you guys are getting very panicky as I keep unnecessarily attacking him which requires

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,380
 him to defend his position which prevents him from attacking me, but once again, I have

20
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,380
 a plan.

21
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,380
 H6.

22
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,020
 Ah ha, that blunders a pawn and allows my queen to infiltrate into his position, but

23
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,500
 since I need to lose instead of win, I'll take it.

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,380
 Rook G8.

25
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,580
 My secret weapon?

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,580
 Resignation.

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:36,900
 Ha, gotcha bitches, and since the video is so short, I'll answer some of my comments

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,900
 instead.

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,020
 Chess, but stockfish ends my video.

30
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,740
 In case you don't know, stockfish is not that powerful.

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,340
 LOL you are funny, subbed.

32
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,500
 Plus one baby.

33
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:56,340
 You only use condoms once question mark exclamation mark question mark exclamation mark.

34
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,660
 That is why I always suggest a man to have at least 10 pieces in his wallet.

35
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,540
 The outro was nowhere near giga chad as the rest of the video.

36
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:19,020
 Or permaband.

37
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,440
 (crowd cheering)
