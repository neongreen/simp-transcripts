1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
 100 rated chess, but you can't move any pieces or pawns, one square at a time.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,200
 Yeah, f*** the pawns then. We get a 2 2 7 from Pakistan.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,000
 E4, for anyone that cannot count, that is 2 squares.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,200
 E5. Aha, so normally when I play against the lower rated players, I like to go D4 E D4 C3

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:31,120
 the Danish gambit. But for this challenge, I cannot go C3 because that is a 1 square move.

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:41,280
 So I guess, knight F3. Knight F6. I'll take this pawn then. He takes my pawn. Aha, now the best

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,840
 move is queen E2 idea is knight F6 knight C6 double attack on the royal couple. But since that is a 1

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,800
 square move. Bishop C4 instead. I mean at least after D5, I can pull my bishop back to defend

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:07,760
 against his queen E7. D5. Bishop E2. F6. That blunders a lot. Bishop H5 G6 knight G6 HG6.

10
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,880
 And I've just realized that I actually cannot take this pawn because that is a 1 square move.

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,320
 I'm so f***ing stupid.

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,320
 It's fine, it's not like I'm gonna lose this game after losing a horsey anyway.

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,880
 F5. Very aggressive. D4. I mean if he plays knight F2 right now, it basically traps my queen because

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,080
 she doesn't have any safe squares to go to, but who plays like that anyway. Right?

15
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:47,920
 Of course. But that blunders a pawn. Ha, now if he can also play G5 allowing bishop H5 check.

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:56,960
 That will be very convenient. Well. That was just a coincidence. Bishop H5 check.

17
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:06,080
 Rook takes. Queen takes check again. King D7. I want to go bishop E5, but again, that is against

18
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:14,720
 the rules. Knight C5. That blunders a horsey, but sadly, that is a 1 square move, so I guess,

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,560
 knight C3. If he plays knight D3 right now, he'll force me to either take his knight with my pawn

20
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,240
 or move my king, which makes me a fool for ending my own video. But I mean who plays like that

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:35,440
 anyway. Right? No doubt. I'll take this pawn. Just like the beginning of the video, he'll take my

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:45,600
 pawn next. Or he can also move his king forward. Knight back. Knight B4. Ah ha, he's obviously

23
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,640
 threatening a check with a rook fork, which forces the video to end. Therefore, long castle. I mean

24
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,840
 technically he still has 2 ways to end the video, but no way that can ever happen anyway. Of course.

25
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,800
 Now I'll take this pawn. Enough preparation, now we take his king. Bishop takes D4. That blunders

26
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,040
 a queen, but I'll take this bishop first. Knight blocks. Taking this knight is best,

27
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,360
 but since that move is 1 square, I have to take his queen instead. Ha, and since I'm threatening

28
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,000
 queen takes D5 checkmate in 1, there is no way he's ending my video right now. Right?

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,640
 What the f-

30
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:49,280
