 100 rated chess, but you must predict your opponent's next move before making your own.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,920
 You must always stay above 50% correct. So even though I'm not accepting donation challenges

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,520
 these days anymore, I'm in dead need of money to buy a car at the moment. So I guess.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,680
 Thank you for your donation. We get a 1 24 from France. Predicting my opponent's move before

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,240
 making my own move will make the game a lot harder to keep track of, especially for the

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:36,240
 beginner viewers. Therefore, I'll change it to. After. E4. Predicting first move is very problematic

7
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,200
 because he can literally play anything here, but of course, I'm not gonna avoid the first

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:51,280
 move like a coward. Predicting E5. Please don't end my video on move 1. Thank you. Accuracy, 100%.

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,320
 So normally I would like to play D4 or Knight F3 here, but those moves also create too many possible

10
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:07,040
 responses. So I guess, Queen H5. This move leaves only 2 popular responses, and I'll go with, Knight C6.

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:18,560
 It's fine, 50% is above 50%. And don't even argue math with me, I'm an Asian. I'll take this pawn.

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,120
 This leaves only 3 possible moves, and of course, I'll go with Queen blocks.

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:30,080
 Correct. I'll take this rook. Queen takes E4 is definitely the play here.

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:41,360
 Please take it. Aha, exactly as planned. Bishop blocks, and since I've moved my bishop,

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:50,160
 Queen takes G2 is definitely the continuation here. Or not. Wow. That move actually creates a

16
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,520
 ton of problems for me, because now not only his queen is very active, but he can also move his

17
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,960
 bishop to any of these squares. Well who cares anyway, Queen takes G8. I'm not attacking his

18
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,160
 queen because there are too many squares she can go to, and since he's pushed his pawn this way,

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,360
 I'm down to guess D4 is the next move. There we go. That move really restricts his queen's activity.

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,680
 D3. I mean he should be able to see, that I'm about to go Bishop H6 delivering a big attack

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,880
 at his king, so Queen back to E7 protecting the bishop and keeping the queen safe is literally

22
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:38,000
 his only choice at the moment. Right? Bishop H6 anyway. Now he has to play Queen E7. Freck.

23
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,560
 One more wrong move and the video's dead, so I have to give a check. King D7 is forced,

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,320
 and this will help bring my percentage back to safety. King D7. F3. This bishop doesn't have

25
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,320
 many possible moves, these moves will only get kicked again by G4, so Bishop E6 protecting the

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:05,600
 F7 pawn is obviously the most optimal move right now. Or not. Knight blocks, I mean even though it

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,520
 is 50%, since he has to go Bishop E6 now, I guess we don't have too much to worry about.

28
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:19,440
 What the fu-
