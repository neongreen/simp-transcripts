1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge once you move one of your horses.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,400
 It's very suspicious to me why the covered challenges always get more reactions than

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,100
 the normal ones.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,920
 But it's not my problem.

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,360
 We get a 100 rated guy from South Africa.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,520
 E4.

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,600
 Let's try something fun.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,980
 F5.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,400
 This is a very famous opening called the King's Pawn Opening, Duras Gambit.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,200
 But don't play this.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,680
 F3.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,440
 I don't want to take that pawn yet.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,240
 E5.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,960
 Knight H3.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,240
 Now I'll take.

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
 Pawn takes.

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,440
 Queen H5 check.

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,240
 Knight F2 is best, but please go G3.

19
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,720
 Thank you.

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,000
 That blunders a rook, Queen takes E4 check.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,720
 Bishop blocks.

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,840
 Free rook.

23
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,240
 Beginners are not very good with rooks as they don't move them very often, so I don't

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,720
 think there is a potential early resignation after I make that capture.

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,120
 Knight G1.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,720
 Ah ha.

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,160
 Now comes the real question.

28
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,100
 Do I take that knight?

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,800
 If I take that horsey, it'll bring my material advantage to +9, which is a very dangerous

30
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,120
 threshold as a resignation is very likely to happen.

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,160
 Well but who cares anyway.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,120
 As always, I'm not a coward.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,320
 Bishop F1 is forced.

34
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,920
 I cannot delay this any further.

35
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,520
 Knight F6.

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,880
 Queen E2.

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:47,320
 That attacks my pawn, but before we deal with that, that horse must deliver a letter to

38
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,480
 your opponent's king that offers them a draw, if your opponent declines, then that horse

39
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,040
 must go all the way back to report to your king.

40
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,880
 You lose if that horse dies at any point while delivering the letter.

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,040
 Well.

42
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,200
 I guess we shouldn't have too much hope for a victory in this game.

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
 D6.

44
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,880
 G4.

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 That blunders a pawn.

46
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:20,680
 And in no world do you take my knight right here.

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,080
 No doubt.

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,680
 It's not safe enough for my knight to touch his king yet, therefore, I have an idea.

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,280
 Queen G3 check.

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,680
 King D1.

51
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,240
 Knight F2 check.

52
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:44,760
 If my knight cannot touch his king, I'll let his king touches my knight instead.

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,160
 There we go.

54
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,840
 Now I send a draw offer, but in this very position, something unexpected happened.

55
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,720
 I got a power outage.

56
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,560
 Therefore, I don't know if my opponent agreed to the draw offer or not, I even had to bring

57
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,080
 my laptop to a cafe to edit this video.

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,920
 Not my fault.

59
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:19,680
