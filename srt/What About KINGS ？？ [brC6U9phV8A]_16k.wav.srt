 100 rated chess, but reverse capture logic, your pawns can only capture pieces, and your

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:15,120
 pieces can only capture pawns. Sounds absolutely terrifying. We get a 198 from the United Kingdom.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:24,160
 E4. Knight c6. D4. I mean technically if he takes my pawn right now, I actually cannot take back

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:35,280
 because a piece cannot take a piece, but who plays like that anyway? Right? Bishop c4. It's fine,

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,920
 unless he decides to also take this pawn with a check and forces me to move my king.

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:50,240
 c6. Not very aggressive. Knight f3. Knight takes f3. Only pawns can capture pieces,

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:58,640
 g takes f3. Queen a5 check. Bishop d2. Somehow I have a feeling that he's gonna blunder his queen

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:07,600
 right now. Are you serious? That blunders a woman, but I cannot take it due to the rules. Bishop b3.

9
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,800
 Queen retreats. Alright. F4. Opening up my queen for a quick attack at his king,

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:23,280
 or else I'm so going to lose this game. Knight f6. E5. Since only my pawns can take his pieces,

11
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,000
 if he can just blunder his knight right now, that will be very convenient. Of course it doesn't

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,760
 happen. Don't want to lose my bishop, not to mention that I also cannot take his knight back.

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:45,200
 Bishop e3. Knight back to f6. Ah ha! Finally! That blunders a horsey. After all of those moves,

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:56,880
 I finally got some material advantage. He takes f6. Queen e2. Queen a5 check. Knight c3. Bishop e4.

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,280
 Very aggressive. That blunders a queen to bishop b6 discovered check and double attack on the queen,

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:11,280
 but since I actually cannot take his queen due to the rules, bishop c5 instead. King d8 is forced.

17
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:19,360
 I'll check with queen. The problem is that I still cannot find any checkmates. King c7. Queen d6.

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,200
 I'm down for a repetition. Maybe not. I can win a bishop, but that is against the rules.

19
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,920
 Long castle. Let's just hope that he'll take my knight instead of my bishop.

20
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:39,840
 Or not take anything at all. Knight d5. The plan is very simple. C takes d5, bishop takes d5,

21
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:49,040
 checkmate in 1. Or he can blunder his queen instead. I'll give a check first. King a6 is forced.

22
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,840
 Okay. Now what? He's threatening queen a1 checkmate in 1, and even though I also have

23
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:04,080
 knight xb4 checkmate in 1, a piece cannot take another piece. Oh well f**k the rules knight xb4,

24
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,120
 checkmate, and since I broke the rules myself, there's no what the f**k today.

25
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:23,440
