00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but the royal couple and the peasants must stay together, the king and queen

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 always have to be touching, and all the pawns also always have to be touching. I personally don't

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,680
 think this is very interesting, but since a lot of people reacted to this one, maybe there is

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:26,000
 something that I'm missing. We get a 168 from Spain. E4. Since the pawns have to stick together,

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,760
 I think I will delay pushing center pawns for now. B6. D4. Bishop B7, expecting knight F3 and I win

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:46,720
 a free pawn. Well, that works too, expecting queen D3 blundering a queen. Of course that doesn't

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:54,000
 happen. G6, I mean a move like bishop takes C7 will end my video because it disconnects my remaining

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:05,360
 pawns, but I mean who plays like that anyway. Right? Of course. I'll go back. Queen D3. Aha!

9
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,880
 As soon as my bishop doesn't control the D3 square anymore, he moves his queen to D3 immediately.

10
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:22,720
 Which is to say, very aggressive. Bishop G7. Queen E4. That blunders a woman. Wow,

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:32,800
 this challenge is going way better that what I imagined. Knight takes E4. D6. Knight 2 C3. Knight

12
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:42,240
 D7. Oh wait I missed a free pawn. Nevermind. I'll take that pawn now, and he should be able to see

13
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:52,000
 that knight takes C7 is just blundering a horsey. Right? Yes. These 3 pieces are scaring me to

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,320
 death right now, therefore, let's try to trade some of them down. Please just don't go crazy

15
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,840
 and take any of these pawns, because if there is just 1 pawn being taken away, the rest of the

16
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:12,080
 pawns will be disconnected, except if that pawn was Hikaru, or Anish. Bishop trade. E takes is

17
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:19,360
 just ending my own video, therefore, knight takes is kinda forced. And even better, now it's very

18
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:28,800
 clear that my queen is defending both of these pawns. What the f-

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:43,440
