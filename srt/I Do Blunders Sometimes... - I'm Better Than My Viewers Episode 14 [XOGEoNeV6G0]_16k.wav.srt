00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 I'm better than my viewers. And that looks fun. Welcome to episode 14 of I'm better than my

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,720
 viewers. And today's challenger is a guy called the king of prudence. Let's see if he's as prudent

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,040
 as he thinks he is. I'll take this first. The idea is if he takes with a pawn, he'll be closing down

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:27,440
 his file while I still have my half opened file. Exactly as planned. But now comes the real problem.

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:33,120
 You see, if I take this rook, rook takes rook rook takes rook rook takes rook, his rook will have a

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,160
 completely free file to play and soon will eliminate all of my pawns over here to make a

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,240
 harem of four women. Therefore, I have to make a waiting move. The idea is I let his rook takes

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:49,440
 first and then I'll take his rook with my pawn, which opens up the way for my rook to go out.

9
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:57,360
 There we go. G takes. The situation is actually still very bad after he takes my pawn,

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,560
 so I mean if he can just not take the pawn for one move, that will be very convenient.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,760
 I think we can all agree that a viewer is obviously not a paid actor.

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,160
 H3. Ha, now I can finally have a normal game when only being down a rook.

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,360
 B takes C4. I don't really want to trade down materials when I'm being down a full rook.

14
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,640
 Therefore, rook B2. I mean that move was pretty meaningless if he takes,

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,760
 but you know, there is always a chance that he won't.

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:40,240
 Ha, I always have faith in my viewers. Rook F1. Alright I know that was a really bad move

17
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,280
 because that allows him to sacrifice, but I need to make progress or the game will be staled.

18
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,200
 Now he takes. C takes, opening up the king should be good for the future,

19
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,360
 and now the question is does he have the testosterone to sacrifice his rook?

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:06,640
 And he does. G takes H3. Rook takes H3. Rook F3. You may ask why rook F3 and not rook F8 to

21
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,920
 counterattack on his pawns. Well, in my defense, I think we can all agree, that we all do blunder

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,640
 rooks endgames sometimes in our lives, and to be honest, I think rook F3 is actually not that bad.

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:30,800
 Rook H1. Ah ha, he's threatening rook take C1 checkmate in 1, so I guess, king C1. No panic,

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,160
 I actually calculated everything that if he really chooses to check me and grab my pawns on the A

25
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,760
 file, he is actually slower than me taking all of his pawns on the G file. Rook take C1 check.

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:55,040
 King D2. Please take this pawn. Very convenient. Rook F8. Rook takes A2. Rook takes G8. Ha, now

27
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,320
 you can see, that even though he got to the base of the pawns first, he now actually needs to take

28
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,520
 my B pawn first before taking my A3 pawn, so it will be rook B2 rook G7 rook A2 again rook G6

29
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:16,000
 rook A3 rook G5 and I am faster. Rook takes B2. Well the plan was supposed to be rook takes G6,

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,040
 but in this position, there is actually an even better move, so if you're interested,

31
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,480
 please feel free to pause the video to find the absolute best move for white, while I don't give

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,680
 you any seconds to do so because people skipped the video, and for those of you who were able to

33
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,200
 find the move, congratulations, and for those of you who paused the video but still couldn't find

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,680
 the move, do so I mean maybe you just want to enjoy the show, and the move was king C1 rook A2

35
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:52,880
 king B1 rook A3 king B2 rook A4 and the rook is trapped. Rook takes G6. Rook sacrifice. C takes

36
00:03:52,880 --> 00:04:00,080
 C takes rook G6 A4, and since this is just a normal rook versus pawns endgame with an unactive king,

37
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,360
 there's no way I'll be losing this even against Magnus Carlsen, so after a few more moves,

38
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:14,800
 I made a new queen, king B3 queen E6 king B4 queen C4 king A3 rook A2. Checkmate. I'm better than my

39
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:22,800
 viewers.
