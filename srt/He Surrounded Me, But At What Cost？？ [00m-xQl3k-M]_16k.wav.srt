00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 I'm better than my viewers, Vietnam War. In Vietnam we call it the American War,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,400
 but what's the difference anyway? Men and women and people in the middle,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,120
 it is another I'm better than my viewers video, and today's viewer is a guy called Cullen1994,

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,880
 with an ELO of whopping 2400 rating points. And it's funny that I've just banned two of

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,760
 his accounts just a few minutes prior to this game. I'll take this pawn first.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,960
 Bishop takes d4. Ah ha, it seems like Stockfish didn't really like that move,

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,320
 so it is my chance to take over the advantage. And that was also not the correct move.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:48,640
 D takes e6. He makes a mistake again, and rook g5 cannot be a wrong move. I mean it wasn't the

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,720
 best move, but it's still a fine move. And in this position, my opponent took a very long time off

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:02,000
 the clock thinking what to do next, so I gave him an offer. Queen f5 is very natural. I mean,

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:14,800
 I'm thinking of something else but I don't know. Alright, it's risky but I'm losing anyway.

12
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,760
 Queen takes c3. So instead of trying to defend his king, he decided to counterattack me on the

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,400
 other side. In this position, there is a textbook and very easy to see checkmate in 10, so if you

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,160
 want an easy morning warmup for an energetic day, please feel free to pause the video right now to

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,560
 find the checkmate pattern, while I don't give you any seconds to do so. Knight e7 king h7 knight f5

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,000
 discover check king h8 bishop d4. And even though the best move right now is obviously king takes

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,040
 d4, knight takes d4. I mean I obviously saw what the best move was, but I decided to give him a

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:03,600
 chance at continuing the game. Rook g8. Queen f7. Knight f2 check. King e3. It's always good to play

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:17,120
 with your food. Knight g4 check. King d2. Queen g2 check. King c3. Knight f6. Queen f6 rook g7,

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:24,080
 and even though queen g7 is checkmate in 1, rook takes g2. As a grandmaster once said,

21
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,400
 if you see a mate in 1, look for better. Rook g8 queen check rook blocks queen takes h7.

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,320
 Checkmate. I'm better than my viewers.

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:49,120
 So,
