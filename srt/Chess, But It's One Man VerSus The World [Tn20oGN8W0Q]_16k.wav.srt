00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
 100 rated chess, but once you develop a piece, not pawn, you must use that piece until it

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,320
 gets captured.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,480
 Very funny.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,640
 We get a 291 from the US.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:21,600
 I'm pretty sure there is no way to complete this mission, but still, let's try our best.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,080
 E4.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,480
 Let's be hyper aggressive with the pawns.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,480
 Knight C6.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,480
 Aha!

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,880
 Perfect.

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,680
 Bishop B5.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,880
 So I believe the best way to do this is to trade down the pieces as fast as possible,

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,360
 so that we can reach the best endgame, of only kings and pawns.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,160
 Knight F6.

15
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,560
 Bishop takes C6.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,920
 B takes.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,880
 Yes, now I can move the other pieces.

18
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,160
 But of course, there is no need to move them right now.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,000
 E5.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,560
 Knight E4.

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,560
 Very aggressive.

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,000
 D3.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,480
 Knight C5.

24
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,360
 B4.

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,840
 That's a testosterone move right there.

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,600
 Knight A4.

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,240
 C4.

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,160
 D6.

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,120
 That blunders a horsey.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,240
 Should I even take it, though?

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:35,160
 Because if I take his knight, I will have to move my queen, or pawns, until she is captured.

32
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,960
 YOLO.

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,680
 Queen takes A4.

34
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,520
 I mean if I didn't take that knight, people would say that I'm a coward in the comment

35
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,880
 section.

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,160
 D takes E5.

37
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,520
 Queen takes C6 check.

38
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,720
 Please block with your queen, and I promise that I will just trade queens with you, instead

39
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,320
 of going for the rook.

40
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,200
 Bishop blocks.

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,440
 Queen E4.

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,240
 Rook B8.

43
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,800
 C5.

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,440
 A5.

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,640
 I'll take it.

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,320
 Rook B5.

47
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,920
 I'll take this too.

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,240
 F6.

49
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,920
 Queen C3.

50
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,800
 C6.

51
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
 A4.

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,400
 I'm literally making random moves right now.

53
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,560
 Rook takes A5.

54
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,040
 D4.

55
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,240
 E5.

56
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,680
 Opening up the E-file is definitely not the smartest choice here.

57
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,480
 D5.

58
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,840
 C takes D5.

59
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,560
 C6.

60
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,640
 Bishop C8.

61
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,120
 That blunders a rook.

62
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,800
 C7.

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,800
 D4.

64
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,760
 That blunders a queen.

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,280
 C takes D8 equals queen.

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,040
 Check.

67
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,880
 King takes.

68
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,720
 Queen takes A5, check.

69
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
 King D7.

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
 Wow.

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,200
 I can't believe this actually happened.

72
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,760
 Now the game is very easy.

73
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,480
 All I have to do, is to promote my A-pawn, trade it with his rook, and use my queen to

74
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,160
 clean things up, or I can just make a draw by repetition with my queen.

75
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,160
 Alright then, here we go.

76
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
 Queen D5.

77
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
 King E7.

78
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,160
 A5.

79
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,160
 G5.

80
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,160
 A6.

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,160
 Bishop G7.

82
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,160
 A7.

83
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
 Rook D8.

84
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
 Oh wait wait wait.

85
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,400
 That was very sneaky right there.

86
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,400
 Queen C5.

87
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
 Check.

88
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,720
 There is no point to trade down my queen when I can have two queens at once.

89
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
 King E6.

90
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,400
 A8 equals queen.

91
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,240
 The rules only mentioned about the pieces that I developed, and didn't say anything

92
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,520
 about the new pieces I can get from the pawns.

93
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,360
 Therefore, I believe that it's totally fair that I can also move my new queen around,

94
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,280
 along with my old queen.

95
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,160
 Bishop B7.

96
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
 Queen takes D8.

97
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,720
 Once again, this is definitely not cheating.

98
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,720
 And he resigned.

99
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,880
 Mission, accomplished.

100
