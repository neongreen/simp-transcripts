00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
 You saw the thumbnail, and it is real. But anyway, it's the second episode of I'm Better Than My

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,520
 Viewers, and the challenger is a guy called QPS and 8R's first move. If I don't take his rook,

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:22,480
 it's gonna cause a ton of chaos in my territory. Therefore, queen takes d1. I know my king is in

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:30,000
 big danger, but this has to happen first. E5. Ah ha, if you really think about it,

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,360
 even if I take his H pawn, my king will still be trapped in his territory, because the G pawn is

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,120
 protected by his bishop, the H6 square is controlled by the G pawn, and the G6 square is

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,200
 controlled by the F pawn. Therefore, we can easily see that my king will be trapped over there for a

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:53,040
 while, so why not take a free knight, except that knight is not free, and there is a checkmate in

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:02,080
 3 of queen F6 G5 and queen G7, but sadly, I did not see that during the game. And neither did he.

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:09,920
 E4. E4 is also blundering a checkmate in 4. And to be honest, my every move in this game is

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,840
 literally always blundering some sort of checkmate, so feel free to pause the video after every single

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:25,120
 move to find them. D6. D4. Ah ha, that is a very rare case that I did not blunder my king.

13
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:33,200
 E takes D4. Bishop C4. It's really hard to play the game with my king is in so much danger,

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,040
 since my mind can't even calm down to make a justified decision.

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:49,040
 Knight E5. Queen E2. The plan is simple. Bishop G4, F3, bishop E6, bishop takes E6, F takes E6,

16
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,720
 and since his F pawn is no longer controlling the G6 square, I may have my chance to retreat

17
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:04,400
 the poor king. Ah ha, exactly as planned. F3. Yeah f*** you stockfish, how am I supposed to

18
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:11,360
 know that a move which defends my queen is blundering a checkmate in 7. Queen D7. Long

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,400
 castle is coming, but there's nothing I can do about it. F takes G4. Yeah stockfish, I get that

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,040
 knight C3 blundering a knight is definitely a better move than taking a free bishop.

21
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:33,120
 Long castle. Queen F1. The plan is bishop takes F7 knight takes F7 queen takes F7 queen takes F7

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,680
 king takes F7 and I win. Ah ha, that makes the queen trade even easier to happen. Queen takes

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,000
 F7. And to be honest, I have no idea why bringing my queen closer to defend my king is actually

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:57,440
 blundering my king. Bishop E7 check. Only 2 choices. King G7 puts the king on a dark square,

25
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,240
 and since he has a dark square bishop, let's go to a light square instead. And then it turns out,

26
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:13,200
 that light square is a wrong choice. F*** this game dude. Knight F6 check. Please remember that

27
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,560
 I did not know that king G7 was the better move during the game, so I kept my mind that dark

28
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,160
 squares are bad, and went for king G6. Is he gonna C queen G4 check bishop G5 is forced queen takes

29
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:36,880
 E4 check king takes G7 is forced queen takes F7 mate. Sad. But at this very point, something

30
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,440
 unexpected happens. As you can see, my opponent is nowhere to be seen, he got disconnected from

31
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,960
 the game, and even though I can invite him back in, there is absolutely no way I'm going to do

32
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:55,840
 that to let him checkmate me. Therefore, since none of us actually won this game, it is a draw,

33
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
 and I'm still better than my viewers.
