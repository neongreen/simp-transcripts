 100 rated chess, but you have a hot potato. If your opponent catches your piece, or pawn,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,600
 you lose the hot potato. If you capture an opponent's piece, or pawn, you get the hot potato.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,920
 If someone has the hot potato for more than 3 moves, the video ends. It's kinda funny that

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,880
 I'm actually also sitting right next to a hot potato right now. But anyway, we get a 161 from

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:36,240
 Hong Kong. E4. E5. Still theory. D4. I mean this challenge is actually quite easy,

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,280
 unless I get one of those guys who just decide to never capture anything from their opponents.

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:49,440
 Ha! Not this time. Taking this pawn back will immediately bring the potato back,

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,720
 but since each of us can keep it for a maximum of 3 moves. C3. I can always take that potato back,

9
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:05,600
 so why not make him keep it for a little bit longer. D takes C3. Bishop C4. C takes B2. I

10
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,960
 would love to let him keep the potato for one more move, but apparently that won't turn out well for

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,720
 me. So I guess, bishop takes B2. Ha, now whenever I want to give him the potato, I can just make a

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,840
 stupid sacrifice and force him to take, which means he literally can never end this video.

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:33,360
 Knight F6. In case you don't know, this is actually still theory. E5. E5 is not a theory

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,040
 move anymore, and quite frankly, I actually don't even know what the theory move in that position

15
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:47,680
 was. Knight E4. Ah ha, that blunders a pawn to bishop takes F7. Check king takes F7. Queen F3.

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,960
 Checking back to E. A queen takes E4. A very well-known tactic in the opening phase,

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,160
 but since I've only kept the potato for one move, there is no need to rush in giving him back.

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:06,240
 F5. All passant. Alright, now I need him to take this pawn so that I can give the potato back to

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,960
 him, and since I'm obviously threatening queen H5 check G6 F7 check king E7 queen E5 a very

20
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:22,080
 well-known checkmate in 3, there is no way he's not taking that pawn. Right? Absolutely. I'll

21
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,160
 leave this knight for later when he has exhausted his 3 moves of keeping the potato, so for now,

22
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:36,160
 queen H5 check king E7 queen F7 check. I actually haven't seen any checkmates yet,

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:45,600
 so maybe this is not really a good idea. King D6 is forced. Queen D5 check king E7 is forced.

24
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,400
 That exhausted his 3 moves of holding the potato, therefore, I have to take it back. Man how can I

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:04,160
 haven't seen any checkmates yet. King D6. Knight A3. Knight C6. Long castle. King C5. Aha, it is

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,840
 now move number 3 since I started holding the potato, which means I need to force him to make

27
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,800
 a capture, therefore, bishop takes F6. I mean I'm literally forking his queen and his rook here,

28
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:26,560
 so there is obviously no way he's not taking my bishop. Right? Absolutely. Queen D5 king B6 queen

29
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:45,840
 B5 checkmate. Mission accomplished.
