 100 rated chess, but your pieces have scopophobia, they cannot move through a square visited by an

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:15,040
 enemy piece. Or pawn. Let's go, we get a 178 from Australia. E4. In order to avoid my opponent

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,400
 pushing too many pawns and taking away too many squares, I need to push my pawns first.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,760
 D5. Ah ha, the challenge said that I cannot move through a square visited by my opponent,

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,840
 but didn't say that I cannot move on to those squares. Therefore, E takes D5. Queen takes D5.

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,200
 Knights E3. And I guess we'll just assume that knights can jump directly from one square to

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,800
 another, which means the horses are immune to this challenge. And I'm not a coward.

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:55,840
 Queen C6. That blunders a queen. Bishop B5. Ha, maybe he will even resign right now.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:05,200
 Queen D7. Wait. Now if I take his queen, my bishop will be traveling through the C6 square,

10
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,880
 which has been visited by his queen before, which ends the video.

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:19,200
 Wow. Even I didn't see that. D4. I'm sure this guy has a secret camera inside my room.

12
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,280
 C6. I'll go back. It's fine, it's not like I need to win his queen to win this challenge anyway.

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,640
 Knight F6. Bishop G5. And then in this position, something unexpected happened.

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:43,680
 He spent 1 minute and 25 seconds on the clock. To blunder a horsey. And of course I can take it.

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,360
 C5. That continues to blunder a pawn. Well I mean if he can also blunder his queen next,

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,880
 that will be very convenient. I solemnly swear, and I know you guys won't believe it anyway,

17
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,560
 but this guy is 100% not a paid actor. I'll take his queen. Again, we've already agreed that knights

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,560
 jump from one square to another, so it definitely did not travel through the C6 square like chess.com

19
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:25,840
 said. King takes D7. Very aggressive. Bishop F4. E5. D takes E5 discover check. King C7. That

20
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:35,760
 blunders a king. E takes F6 discover check. King B6. Ah ha, now there is queen D8 king C5 queen D5

21
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,320
 king B4 queen B5 checkmate in 3, but since queen D8 is traveling through the D5 and D7 square,

22
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:52,800
 I cannot do that due to the rules. So I guess, queen D4 check. King A5. Queen D5. Resignation.

23
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,160
 Mission accomplished.

24
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:10,320
