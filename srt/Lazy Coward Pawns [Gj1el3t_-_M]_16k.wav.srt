1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 100 rated chess, but your pawns refuse to move unless when their lives are at risk.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,380
 This sounds very cowardly, but since it is not about me, I'll do it for the video.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,040
 We get a 198 from Brazil.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,600
 And as you can see, none of the pawns are at risk right now, therefore, I have to move

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
 a horsey.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,240
 D5.

7
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,600
 Again, still no pawns being threatened.

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,780
 Knight c3.

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:33,000
 I mean if he pushes d4 to attack my knight, I would gladly let him take it just to open

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,360
 up the way for the other pieces to move out.

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,080
 c6.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,920
 Not very aggressive.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,200
 Knight b1.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,560
 Well I mean at least after he develops his bishop, my c-pawn will be at risk of losing

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:51,080
 his life, which then allows me to play like a normal person.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,020
 Or he can just absolutely block away his bishop's way.

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,020
 Knight c3.

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:01:00,760
 Well, at least I know this video is going to be very long.

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,800
 E5.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,340
 Very aggressive.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,400
 Knight g1.

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,900
 I mean moving the queen out will definitely help me a lot.

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,900
 And again, he decided to block away his queen instead.

24
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,160
 Knight b1.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,160
 My position is absolutely wonderful.

26
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,880
 D4.

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,480
 Ah ha, even though I said that I would sacrifice a knight just to open up my position, now

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:31,080
 when I rethink about that idea, it sounds like what a coward would do to avoid the challenge's

29
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,080
 difficulty.

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,920
 Therefore, knight f3.

31
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,920
 No need for any sacrifices, I will win this game fair and square.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,640
 c5.

33
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
 Knight a3.

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,000
 Man, I've just realized that I should've played knight a3 sooner so that he can take my knight

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,240
 which attacks my pawn and allows me to open up my position.

36
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,180
 E4.

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,440
 Knight g1.

38
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,120
 That's fine, knight h3 next, and there's no way he's not taking it.

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,640
 Knight e5.

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,960
 Here we go.

41
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
 Knight h3.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,400
 Alright, take this horsey, and we'll officially start the game.

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,320
 Knight f3 check.

44
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,680
 Wait.

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,120
 I didn't even see that.

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,560
 That blunders a horsey, but since none of these pawns are being threatened, I cannot

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,720
 move them according to the rules.

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,720
 And my king is stuck.

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,080
 So basically this is a checkmate.

50
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,360
 What the f-

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:44,940
