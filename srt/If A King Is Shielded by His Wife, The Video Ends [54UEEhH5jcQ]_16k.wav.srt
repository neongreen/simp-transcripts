1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
 If your opponent's queen is in front of their king, the video ends.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,080
 Wow, this challenge actually reminds me of this thing.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,000
 Therefore, let's also count my queen in, since I definitely cannot let my queen have fun

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,800
 with his king, and also add another rule, that I cannot capture my opponent's queen,

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,000
 since that will make the challenge too easy.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,100
 Let's go.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,000
 We get a 1 16 from the US.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,420
 E4.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:37,400
 Now queen E2 is the threat, and since I don't have any ways to prevent it, let's try to

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,400
 keep him busy instead.

11
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
 D5.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,680
 Oh wait.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,300
 On second thought, maybe helping him opening up his E file is not that good of an idea.

14
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,960
 My bad.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
 Queen F3.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,620
 Ah ha.

17
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,460
 He obviously wants me to take his E pawn, and then he'll take back with his queen, which

18
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,900
 makes me a fool, for helping him ending my video.

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,260
 So I guess.

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,500
 E5.

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,320
 Since he puts his queen on F3, he most likely wants to attack my F7 pawn, so there's no

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,580
 reason to move her to E2 or E3.

23
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,580
 Right?

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,740
 E takes D5.

25
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,000
 Knight F6.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,820
 I'm not gonna lie, this video is actually doing pretty well.

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,020
 Bishop B5 check.

28
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,580
 Bishop D7.

29
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,500
 Of course I need to keep him busy with his bishop.

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,580
 Bishop takes D7.

31
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,020
 Knight B takes D7.

32
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,340
 D6.

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,700
 I want to play E4 to attack his queen, but of course, that will just provoke him to end

34
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,300
 my video.

35
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,700
 Therefore, bishop takes D6.

36
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,860
 Queen takes B7.

37
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,240
 Very aggressive.

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,620
 But that's actually really good for me, since he cannot end my video anymore.

39
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,100
 Castle.

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,660
 Well, technically he can still end my video with queen E4, but let's be real.

41
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,260
 Who plays like that anyway?

42
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,160
 Right?

43
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,660
 What the hell was that?

44
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,020
 That blunders a queen.

45
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:21,420
 But I cannot take it due to the rules.

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,520
 And I can't even move my queen away, since it puts my queen in front of his king, which

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,380
 means I'll be ending my own video.

48
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,180
 Are you serious?

49
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,820
 Alright.

50
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,500
 It's fine.

51
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,740
 Knight B8 is kinda forced.

52
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,940
 Now don't tell me that you're going to take the knight as well.

53
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,340
 Thank you.

54
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,420
 Let's start an attack, or things will go very wrong very quickly.

55
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,420
 Queen D7.

56
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,180
 Oh wait I blundered queen E3.

57
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,140
 Nah, I mean he already put his queen into my territory, so there's no reason to go back

58
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,140
 now.

59
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,140
 Right?

60
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:09,020
 Yeah that's good, he is now once again cannot end my video.

61
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,520
 Queen G4.

62
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,980
 That puts my queen in front of my king, but of course, my king can have his fun.

63
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,980
 Right guys?

64
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,140
 F3.

65
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,980
 That blunders a rook.

66
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,180
 Queen takes G2.

67
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,720
 F4.

68
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,300
 That blunders a queen, but once again, I cannot take it, due to the rules.

69
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,140
 Therefore, E4.

70
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,420
 And in no world do you take it now.

71
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,900
 Of course.

72
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,740
 Queen takes H1.

73
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,020
 Now if you really think about it, this challenge is actually really easy, since all we have

74
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:59,060
 to do, is just to avoid a single file.

75
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:09,980
 F4.

76
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,560
 (upbeat music)

77
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
 Oh
