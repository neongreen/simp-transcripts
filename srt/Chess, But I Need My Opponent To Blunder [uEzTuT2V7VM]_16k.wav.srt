1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but you can only capture if your opponent blunders.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Well, normally, I don't take on missions that are too easy to accomplish,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 but of course, I can't argue with money.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Therefore, let's find an opponent.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 We get a 229 from Vietnam.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 And to be fair, I will be the one to judge whether a move is a blunder or not,

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 because I cannot use stockfish during the game.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 E4.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 E5.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 Still theory.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 And since this mission is so easy according to my thinking, let's make it a bit harder.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 King E2.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 And I will not pull my king back, since I'm a real man, and not a coward.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 D6.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 Not very aggressive.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Knight C3.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 Bishop G4 check.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Very aggressive.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 Just as I was saying that he's not very aggressive, he gave me a really aggressive move,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 which makes him neutral.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 But anyway, knight F3 looks pretty attractive, because after bishop takes F3,

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 G takes F3 opens the way to develop my bishop.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But sadly, after bishop takes F3, I cannot take back because it's just a trade,

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 and not a blunder.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 Therefore, F3 is kinda forced.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Queen H4.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 That blunder's a bishop.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Queen takes G4 check.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 Now king E1 should be the best move, but as I said, a real man don't pull his king back.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 And even if I do pull it back, queen takes D1 is actually winning my queen,

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 because since it's not a blunder, I cannot take his queen back.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Therefore, knight F3 is kinda forced.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 D5.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 That blunder's a pawn.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 I know a lot of people are going to say, that since he can also take my pawn back,

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 it's actually just a pawn trade, not a blunder.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 But no.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 From my point of view, that was him blundering his D pawn, and then me blundering my E pawn back.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Therefore, taking his D pawn, is not against the rules.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Queen takes E4 check.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 Knight E3 is kinda forced.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Queen C6.

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Ah ha!

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Very tricky.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 He's probably thinking that after knight takes E5, queen B5 check,

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 knight D3, queen H5 check will skew my king and queen, which will help him take my queen,

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 and then I cannot take back due to the mission.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 But sadly, that doesn't work.

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Knight takes E5.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Queen B5 check.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 This guy's really good, he saw all of those things I've just shown you guys.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Knight D3.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 Queen H5 check.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Yeah, he really did see all of those moves.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 But sadly, I do have

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 G4.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Queen G5.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 Bishop G2.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 Bishop C5.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 That blunders a rook.

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Bishop takes B7.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 And he resigned.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Mission, accomplished.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:37,000
