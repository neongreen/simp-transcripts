1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but you have to extend the game to over 100 turns.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,500
 Playing 5 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,500
 And wow, that's a lot of money.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,500
 I actually haven't received any donations in the past few weeks,

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,500
 which makes me really sad, thinking that people already got bored of my videos.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 So dude, that $100 means more, than just money to me.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,500
 But anyway, back to the video.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:43,500
 I'll be honest, I have never played a game, that lasts over 100 moves.

9
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
 So this time, I also don't think I can do it.

10
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:54,500
 The result is going to be, either my opponent resigns, or his time runs out.

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
 But of course, it's not like I'm scared of it or something.

12
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
 Let's find an opponent.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:08,500
 We get a 1-0-3 from the US.

14
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,500
 With premium membership.

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
 And a cat profile picture.

16
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
 E4.

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,500
 E5.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
 Queen H5.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Don't panic guys, I have a plan.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,500
 Knight F6.

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,000
 That blunders a pawn.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 But no, I won't take that pawn.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 So the thing that makes this mission so hard, is that my opponent can just resign,

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 at any time during the game.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Therefore, take this.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Queen takes F7.

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
 Check.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 King takes.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,500
 Now that he has 8 points of material advantage,

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,000
 he should have no reason to resign from the game.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,500
 Bishop C4 check.

32
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
 D5.

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 Very aggressive.

34
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
 I'll take it.

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,000
 I know it brings his advantage from +8 down to +7.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 There's still no way that he's going to resign.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,500
 Right?

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,000
 E4.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,500
 Again, very, aggressive.

40
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
 Knight C3.

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
 Bishop F5.

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
 Knight E2.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 C5.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,500
 That blunders a lot.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,500
 En passant.

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,500
 Check.

47
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,000
 Bishop block.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,500
 Wow!

49
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,000
 That's a lot of testosterone right there.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 Alright.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,500
 As you wish.

52
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,000
 Bishop takes E6.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,500
 King takes.

54
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,000
 C takes B7.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
 Ok.

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Now I can only hope that my opponent won't get panic and resign from the game.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Just calm down,

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 move your knight,

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 and everything is fine.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Yes.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,500
 Now.

62
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,000
 Here comes the big question.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,500
 Do I take his rook?

64
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,000
 I mean after I take his rook,

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 he will no long have an advantage,

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 which may cause him to be sad,

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
 and then quit the game.

68
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,500
 Aha!

69
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,000
 I know.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,500
 I'll take it,

71
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,000
 but I'll make a horsey instead.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Because if you look at the material difference,

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,500
 I'm only having a +2 advantage.

74
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,000
 But if I had made a queen,

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,500
 that +2 would have been a +8,

76
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,000
 which may cause him to resign.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Queen takes A8.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,500
 Yes.

79
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,000
 Now he's up +1 again.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 Of course it's very risky playing at this small difference,

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 so I guess I'll try to sacrifice some more later on.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Castle.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Knight G4.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,500
 D4.

85
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,000
 I'm threatening D5,

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 but let's see if he learned the French move.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 Amazing!

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,500
 C takes D3.

89
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,000
 Bishop D6.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,500
 Knight G3.

91
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,000
 Knight takes H2.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 Dude!

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 That blunders a horsey!

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 But should I even take it though?

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Because if I take his knight,

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I will officially be up in material,

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 which may cause him to rage quit.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 Okay.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 I have to take it.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 If I don't take it,

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 that horsey will jump around in my territory,

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 without any mercy.

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Knight D4.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I'll go back.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Knight C2.

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 Very aggressive.

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Rook B1.

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Bishop B4.

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 Bishop B4.

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 Okay.

111
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 It's time to give him back some materials.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 Knight D5.

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Queen takes.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 Bishop E3.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Let's give him some more.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Queen takes A2.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Rook Fc1.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Knight takes E3.

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,500
 F takes E3.

120
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,000
 H5.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Very aggressive.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,500
 Knight E4.

123
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,000
 H4.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 Again, very aggressive.

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Rook A1.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 Queen takes B2.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 That blunders a bishop!

128
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
 Rook Cb1.

129
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,500
 Queen E2.

130
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
 Rook takes B4.

131
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
 G5.

132
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,000
 Man!

133
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
 This guy is really aggressive.

134
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
 But anyway,

135
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
 that blunders a pawn!

136
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,000
 King F6.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,500
 Ah ha!

138
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
 It looks like he wants to attack my knight.

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,500
 I think now I have...

140
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
 Rook K6 check.

141
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
 King takes B5.

142
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
 Rook B5 check.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 King G4 is forced,

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 and then rook G6.

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Checkmate!

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,500
 But sadly,

147
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
 that is only about 30 moves into the game,

148
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
 which is still very far away from a hundred.

149
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
 Therefore,

150
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,000
 let's just go back.

151
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,500
 King F5.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Let's make a trap.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 G3.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,500
 I know that it's a bad move,

155
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
 but it looks cool.

156
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,500
 Ha ha!

157
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
 He fell for it.

158
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,000
 Now I have knight takes G3,

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,500
 which comes with a royal fork.

160
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
 But once again,

161
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,000
 should I even do it though?

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
 I mean right now,

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 he's having A+1 lead.

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,500
 But if I do that,

165
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,500
 it will become A+9 lead for me.

166
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,000
 Oh wait.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 What am I thinking?

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,500
 If I don't do the royal fork,

169
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
 the people in the comment section

170
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,500
 are going to backseat me so much

171
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
 about blundering that G pawn,

172
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,500
 without getting anything in return.

173
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,000
 Also,

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,500
 his time is very low already,

175
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,500
 so if he has fewer materials on the board,

176
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,000
 he is less likely going to waste his time.

177
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
 Knight takes G3 check.

178
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,000
 King F6.

179
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Knight takes E2.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Rook G8 check.

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,500
 Ah ha!

182
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,000
 Perfect time to give back some materials.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 Rook G4.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,500
 Why is he thinking for so long?

185
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,000
 Finally!

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 King F2.

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Alright,

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,500
 let's speed up the video.

189
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:19,000
 Rook takes E3.

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 That blunders a rook.

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,500
 Okay.

192
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
 Now is the video's fate.

193
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,000
 If he resigns,

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,500
 the mission is failed.

195
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,000
 If he doesn't,

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,500
 the mission is a success.

197
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,500
 Thank you.

198
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
 Rook F7.

199
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
 Here's my plan.

200
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,000
 I'll use my rook to cut his king off,

201
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 and then I'll walk my king from top to bottom,

202
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,500
 push my pawn,

203
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
 and then bottom to top,

204
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
 push my pawn,

205
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 and then top to bottom,

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,500
 push my pawn,

207
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
 and so on.

208
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,000
 And since he only has a king,

209
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,500
 there is no way his time is running out.

210
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
 Let's go.

211
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:13,500
 Oh wait wait wait.

212
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 Ha ha!

213
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
 Can't catch me babe.

214
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
 *knock knock*

215
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
 *knock knock*

216
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:29,500
 What the f-

217
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
 *outro music*

218
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500

219
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
