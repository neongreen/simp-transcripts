 100 rated chess, but your opponent has to blunder their queen 3 times before you win.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,520
 Ha, if there is one thing I can say about my opponents,

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,400
 is that they always blunder their queens. We get a 1 1 0 from the Philippines.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,200
 E4. So in order to let my opponent blunder his queen, I need to open up the position so that

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,520
 he'll have a lot of squares to move his queen around. And it will be a bit more problematic

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:36,320
 if he keeps playing like a coward like this. D4. Bishop D6. E5. Kicking the bishop away,

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,680
 and I will take the D pawn whenever he decides to push it forward.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,080
 Or he can just take my pawn instead. That blunders a bishop, but if I take that bishop,

9
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:51,760
 he may decide to resign the game before managing to blunder his queen 3 times. So I guess,

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,520
 knight F3. I mean as long as he doesn't go too wild with his bishop, the game is still under my

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:10,080
 control. Absolutely. Bishop D3. Bishop E4 check. It feels like this guy is doing some sort of

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,600
 challenge that requires you to only move 1 piece at a time. C3. Well, I mean if he wants to move

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:26,320
 only his bishop, I'm giving him another reason to do so. Queen E7. Ah ha. He's been moving his

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,280
 bishop the entire game, but as soon as it is attacked, he decided to stop doing so.

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:40,160
 Very logical. I'll take it this time. I mean taking pieces is probably not a very good idea,

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,840
 but queen E7 was obviously to defend his bishop against my pawn, so taking that bishop comes with

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,800
 a great chance to lure his queen out of her territory. Exactly as planned. Knight blocks.

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:00,000
 Queen back to D6. I suspect this guy has a very special relationship with the D6 square.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,040
 Knight E4. I mean I cannot take his queen, but in order to make him blunder his queen 3 times,

20
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,560
 I of course need to attack her first. Queen B4 check. Again. And you know what,

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,800
 I'll block with my bishop. Provoking his queen to come even closer, but somehow I feel like he's

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,720
 just gonna go back to D6 and blunder his queen for the first time. I solemnly swear, that this guy is

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,720
 not a paid actor, and seriously, even if I hire a paid actor, I would have told him to do better

24
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:46,080
 than this. But anyway. One down, two more to go. What the fu-
