1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 100 rated chess, but every piece, not pawn, must see their mom and dad, which are the

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,180
 queen and king, before they die.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:15,000
 Applying this rule to my opponent's pieces sounds way too difficult, so let's just say,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 your piece.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Let's go, we get a 2 76 from India.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,920
 Knight f3, alright now this knight sees his daddy, now we only need him to see his mommy,

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,240
 and then he'll be allowed to die.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,960
 E5.

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,200
 That blunders a pawn.

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:38,080
 Knight f6, knight c3, unlike the other knight, this knight gets to see his mom first, so

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,720
 now he only needs to see his dad before he dies.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,400
 Man, this video is actually getting pretty sad.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,680
 Rook g8.

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,400
 I have no idea what that move does.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
 E4.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,440
 Bishop c5.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,920
 Ok.

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,320
 Here we go.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
 King e2.

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,260
 Ha, now this knight has finally seen both of his parents, which means he is allowed

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,440
 to die, and the plan is knight back to f3, queen e1 so that the other knight will finally

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,920
 see his mom, and then king d1 to keep the king safe, which we can call, as the castle

23
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,520
 with the queen technique.

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,960
 Knight g4.

25
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,700
 That blunders a horsey, but this is actually very dangerous though, because this knight

26
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,580
 has only seen his daddy, so if my opponent decides to do something dangerous right now

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,400
 to take it, there's a big chance that the video is dead.

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,880
 Queen h4.

29
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
 Very aggressive.

30
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880
 F3.

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,000
 In no world do you take my horsey right now.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,080
 Thank you.

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,720
 That blunders a woman.

34
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,800
 Ha, that was probably the most convenient move possible for me, because not only do

35
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,960
 I get to win his queen, but now this horsey also gets to see his mom, which means he is

36
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,480
 allowed to die, so bishop f2 doesn't even end the video, but only helps me trading down

37
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,000
 one more piece.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,560
 Bishop takes f2.

39
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,560
 King takes f2, my light square bishop saw his dad, so now I only have to go bishop e2

40
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,560
 to see the mom, and then this bishop is also allowed to die.

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,680
 D5.

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,360
 I'll take this pawn first.

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,680
 Knight c6.

44
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,400
 That blunders a fork, but I mean do I even want to take his rook though, because I don't

45
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,880
 really have any other pieces to use right now due to the rules, and moving the knight

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,040
 back obviously sounds way too impossible.

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,420
 Nevermind.

48
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,640
 So normally I would say mission accomplished, but since this guy played like he was the

49
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,680
 biggest paid actor of all time, I'm not gonna say that today, but instead I'll say.

50
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,280
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor.

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:03:03,320
