1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 100 rated chess, but you have pawn structure superiority.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,200
 Your opponent needs to have 2 sets of triple dissolated pawns.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,280
 Before you checkmate.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,520
 You know what? It actually doesn't sound so hard.

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,640
 We get a 181 from Bangladesh.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,560
 F4. The pan is very simple.

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,280
 He goes E5, E takes F4, and then we have a doubled pawn.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,960
 D5. C4. Same plan as the other side.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,440
 But then he doesn't take.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,880
 I can already see, that this guy will make a very annoying opponent.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,160
 D4. I need my pawns alive so I can reposition his pawns.

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,360
 Nevermind.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,600
 That blunders a woman.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,720
 I don't want to win by resignation because it ruins the purpose of the challenge,

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,920
 but if he wants to resign, nothing I can do about it.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,560
 Knight.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,960
 Thank you.

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,720
 Knight C3.

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,440
 Ah ha! After all those moves, he has finally capture the pawn.

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,960
 G3.

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
 Knight D7.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880
 Bishop G2.

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,360
 Knight GF6.

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,960
 Here we go.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,880
 Bishop C6.

26
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
 The plan is very simple.

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,880
 He takes, and we have 1 set of tripled pawns.

28
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:35,360
 For some reason, this guy managed to blunder his queen on move 3,

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,600
 then he missed my free bishop, but he knows how to queen side castle,

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,520
 which is a very advanced technique.

31
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,320
 E4.

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,480
 E6.

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,560
 Ah ha! He doesn't want to take my bishop.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,080
 I'll take his bishop then.

35
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,200
 Any of these captures are good for the video.

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,280
 Bishop G5.

37
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,320
 Alright. The plan is very simple.

38
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,800
 He takes my bishop, he takes my pawn, I take his knight, he takes my bishop.

39
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,640
 The challenge is a success.

40
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,200
 And since my bishop is pinning his knight, this capture is totally inevitable.

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,680
 You know what? I'm not playing this game anymore.

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,920
 This opponent is a very good player.

43
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,240
 I'm not playing this game anymore.

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,640
 This opponent is way over my level.

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
 Continuing this will harm my mental health.

46
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,320
 Have a great day.

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:44,960
