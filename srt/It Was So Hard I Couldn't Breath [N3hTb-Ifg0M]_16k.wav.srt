00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 100 rated chess, but you can only use half of the board, every 5 moves you have to switch

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,960
 to the other half. So there is a huge question about this challenge. How do we divide the board?

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,800
 This way, or this way? Doesn't make any sense. This way, is way too dank, because there is no

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,360
 way I can last 5 moves when it is his territory turn. Therefore, I think we can all agree,

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:35,840
 that we will divide the board, this way. Let's go, we get a 2 59 from Spain. With platin and

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,800
 membership. Since I can only play on half of the board, let's start with, the king side. The best

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,640
 case scenario is that I can castle my king within 5 moves and switch to play on the queen side.

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:59,360
 E5. Knight f3. Nothing wrong so far. Knight f6. I'll take this pawn. He takes my pawn,

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,800
 aha, now queen e2 is very strong and is also the next book move, but sadly, my queen is on the

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,120
 other side of the board, which means I cannot move her right now. So I guess, knight back to f3.

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,760
 Bishop c5. Oh. Now he's attacking my f2 pawn, and there is no way I can defend it,

12
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:32,000
 because d4 is against the rules. F***. Bishop c4. Alright, it's fine, at least let's just hope that

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,800
 he will take with knight, because if he takes with bishop, that is a check, which means I have

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:42,720
 to move my king, but since it's already 5 moves on the board, I have to switch to queen side,

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,800
 which means I cannot move my king, which means I have to end the video.

16
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:56,800
 Ha! That works too. d4. I mean he can still play knight f2 and take my rook for free,

17
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:05,680
 but at least the video will survive. Bishop d6. Knight c3. Man, it's so hard to just think of one

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,720
 half of the board, and even though I knew that this would happen, I'm still using way too much

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,680
 time than expected. Knight c6. That blunders a horsey, but that will put my knight on the other

20
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,280
 side of the board, which means it cannot be moved for a few moves, and if he plays queen e7 to

21
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,440
 attack both my knight and my king that cannot move, that will be very dangerous. Therefore,

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,360
 knight d5, at least I can force this very dangerous queen to go back to its starting square.

23
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,880
 Nevermind. That blunders a woman, but since I'm still stuck with the woman side, I cannot take

24
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,960
 her, and since she's threatening checkmate in 1, knight takes c7 check is kinda forced.

25
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:57,280
 King d8. One more move, knight e6 check is kinda forced. I'm sure there will be a lot of people

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,160
 saying that this knight move and bishop c4 at the beginning are breaking the rules since they

27
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,760
 crossed the half-board line, but to be honest, if I also have to keep the pieces on that same half

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,440
 of the board, the mission will become too hard, to a point that I believe even Magnus Carlsen won't

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:24,320
 be able to complete. F takes e6. Alright, back to the king's side, knight takes h4. Knight takes d4.

30
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,440
 That blunders a knight but I cannot take due to the rules, and since the horses are obviously

31
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,840
 aiming to give some crazy checks to my king, let's just castle, now even if knight e2 I can

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:45,520
 still move my king away. Rook f8. He's coming at me. F3. Okay I know that was a bad move, but I only

33
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:50,720
 had a few pieces to move, and the time pressure got me literally trapping my own knight because

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:04:00,480
 my bishop cannot move. Knight g5. Well, at least now he can't move his pawn to g5. G4. I'm just

35
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,640
 making random moves right now, I'm using way too much time, and I'm having a serious time pressure.

36
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:18,480
 Knight h3 check. King g2. Knight f4 check. Ha! Exactly on time. Bishop takes f4. Rook takes f4.

37
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,360
 C3. At least now he cannot check me anymore, so let's just hope that I can checkmate him within

38
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,760
 these very few moves. Knight back to c6 queen takes d6 knight e7 that blunders a rook but who

39
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:39,760
 gives a s*** bishop takes e6 b5 rook a d1 bishop b7. That blunders a king, but sadly, it's time for

40
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,800
 king's side moves. But actually, f*** the rules, I'm very low on time already, queen takes d7

41
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,320
 checkmate. The mission is failed, but at least I won.

42
00:04:50,320 --> 00:05:04,960
