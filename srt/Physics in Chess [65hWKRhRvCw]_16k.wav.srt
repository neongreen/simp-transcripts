 100 rated chess, but there's physics, your pieces, and pawns, must always have pieces,

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,280
 or pawns, stacked under them or they'll fall and die. I think Newton will be very happy in his

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:22,320
 grave. We get a 2 35 from Italy. E4. Imagine if I push E5, my E pawn won't be having anything

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,240
 stacked under him on E7 and E6. Which means he will be falling and die. Therefore, knight C6. And

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,960
 let's just say that the pawns don't fall from their starting position, because if they do I

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:44,960
 don't even know what the f*** I am supposed to do anymore. Queen F3. Knight F6. D3. Alright,

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,480
 so now the question is, what do I do? Knight G8. No worries, I'll make progress soon enough.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:01,920
 Knight H3. Change of plan. Knight H6. The plan is very simple, he takes my knight, I can take his

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,840
 bishop because my pawns is stacked, rook G8 being the base for bishop G7 means I can finally develop

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,480
 my first piece of the game. Unless he doesn't want to take. I need this knight here to defend my F

11
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,960
 pawn. So I can only move this knight. To be honest, this challenge seems a lot harder than I thought,

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,440
 so if he can just blunder his queen right now, that will definitely help a lot.

13
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:35,280
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. Knight takes F7 is forced. My knight is

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,480
 supported by my bishop, so he doesn't fall, as long as the bishop's muscles don't wear out.

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:51,920
 Knight takes F7. King takes F7. Resignation. Wow. I thought this would be a very long game

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,680
 and I'll have to do many things to win, but I guess sometimes we just have to get a short video.
