2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 You're a stupid child, chasing your dreams and getting hurt

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 You're a bad liar, but you can't smile

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 You don't even say "I love you" well, you're really clumsy

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 But, but why did you say "goodbye"?

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 You're no good, no good, no good

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I love you, I love you too much

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 No matter how strong the alcohol

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Memories are like a fool
