00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
 100 rated chess, but it's American Independence Day, no pieces, or pawns, can die on such a happy

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,960
 day. Let's go, we get a 2 2 9 that is not from America. Pushing center pawns is just asking them

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:23,920
 to be taken. Therefore, knight f3, expecting e5 and I win a pawn. Very convenient. That blunders

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,160
 a pawn, since my opponent is not from the US, his pieces and pawns don't have to live to celebrate

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:38,240
 the day. Queen e7. Very aggressive. I'll go back, I mean queen takes e2 will immediately end the

6
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,680
 video right now and everyone will cry for Edward's death instead of having fun in a holiday,

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:53,360
 but who plays like that anyway? Right? No doubt. Knight c3. Okay I mean taking one of these horses

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,920
 also ends the video, and actually, when you think about it, he played queen e7 to attack my knight,

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,160
 I moved my knight to f3, and then he moved his queen to f6, maybe his purpose was to take my

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:14,400
 knight at all cost. Of course not. D3. Okay I know pushing center pawns is very dangerous,

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,320
 but since his e-pawn is already dead, his c-pawn is the only pawn that can harm my video,

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,120
 and not many people are aggressive enough to push their c-pawn forward. Queen e6. In every other

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,720
 videos, I would have gone knight b5 to try my luck at forking his queen, but in this game,

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,160
 even if I can win the woman, a pawn can still take my knight and absolutely destroy the video.

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:48,400
 Therefore, g3. No need to rush. Knight f5. Bishop h3. I mean now knight e3 will pretty much force

16
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:53,920
 the video to end, but he should be able to see, that knight e3 is actually blundering to bishop

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,240
 takes e6 knight takes d1 knight b5 brilliant move knight a6 bishop h3 and his knight is trapped.

18
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:09,680
 Right? Always have faith in the 100 rated players. That blunders a horsey to e4 bishop f5,

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:17,200
 but again, pushing center pawns is obviously way too dangerous, therefore, knight d4. In no world

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:26,480
 do you take my horsey. On second thought, maybe I was a fool because that move was probably the

21
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
 best move. But anyway, happy birthday America.
