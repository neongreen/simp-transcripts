00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 100 rated chess, but it's Halloween, if you scare an opponent's piece.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,160
 Not porn, but they don't run away, the video ends scarily.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,440
 This is going to be short. We get a 121 from the United Kingdom.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,760
 With diamond membership.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,360
 D4. E5.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,480
 Since the challenge is not applied to the pawns, it is definitely a great idea to just kill all

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,280
 the pawns and open up the position for a quick attack at his king before he can end my video.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,120
 C3. Not very aggressive.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,720
 D5. Knight F3.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,440
 Ah ha. Here we go.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,960
 E4. Alright, now I'm scaring this knight, so if he doesn't move it, the video ends,

12
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,240
 but since this attack is just as obvious as the fact that my viewers are absolutely maidenless,

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,200
 there's no way he's not seeing it. Right?

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:06,720
 Of course. That blunders a horsey to F6, but if I play F6 right now, maybe he'll realize that his

15
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,240
 knight is actually trapped and then refuse to move it away, which breaks the rules and ends the video.

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,280
 So I guess, bishop D6. This move is not scaring the knight because it is defended by a pawn,

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,200
 so even if he doesn't move it away, the video will still continue.

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,240
 But then somehow he still decided to move it.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,400
 King takes, that was unbelievably convenient.

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
 Knight D2. Ah ha.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,760
 E3. The challenge said that if I scare a piece, that piece needs to move, now I'm scaring this

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,520
 knight, so if he takes my pawn instead of moving the knight, the video ends, but he should be able

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,440
 to see, that F takes E3 is obviously blundering, queen H4, check G3, bishop takes G3, check H takes

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,680
 G3, queen takes G3, a very textbook checkmate in 3, so of course he'll have to move his knight right

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,040
 now. Right?

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,640
 What the f-
