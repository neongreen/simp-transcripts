1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 If the opponent makes a aggressive move, you play a passive move and vice versa.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Well, I guess we can barely understand that.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 But anyway, we get a 139 from Philippines.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 F3. Aha, since it's his first move, I don't think it is either aggressive or passive, but it's just a normal opening move.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Therefore, I believe that I'm allowed to make any moves right now, regardless of its aggressive level.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 E5.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Night H3. Not very aggressive. Which means, I have to make an aggressive move.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 D5. Even though it's just a normal developing move, D5 helps me take the full center, and I think we can all agree that it is an aggressive opening plan.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Ok here comes the bad things. Knight G5 is very aggressive, because it's the second knight move in a row, and it also advanced his knight into my half of the board.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Therefore, even though that's a free horsey, I cannot take it, since developing the queen first is also very aggressive, which ends the video.

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 So I guess, knight H6. Somehow I have a big feeling that he's gonna go absolutely crazy and go knight takes F7.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 Ha, you see, my experience from playing against 100 rated players has just saved my video.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 King takes F7 is advancing my king, which is very aggressive, which ends the video, since his horsey is already way too aggressive.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Therefore, knight takes F7. Even though I took his knight, I was also retreating my knight, so I believe that it's still following the rules.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Knight A3. Not very aggressive, because he could have developed it to C3, but he chose to put his knight on the rim instead.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Therefore, bishop takes A3.

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 Rook G1. That would have been fun if it was the other rook. But anyway, developing a rook to a closed file is definitely, not very aggressive.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 Therefore, bishop C5. Even though that's a bishop's retreat, it still gives me an attack on his rook, which can also be considered as a very aggressive move.

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 B3. Not very aggressive. Therefore, bishop takes G1. Sir, please play seriously. At this point, people will say that you're a paid actor.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Bishop G2. Developing a bishop to a closed diagonal is of course, not very aggressive.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Bishop takes H2.

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 What the hell was that?

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 White, advancing the king is definitely very aggressive. Therefore, castle. I think we can all agree that moving the king away from the center is always a passive move.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Bishop H3. That blunders a bishop, but sadly, very aggressive. Therefore, knight H6.

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 G4. Very aggressive. So even though I want to play queen H4, I guess I'll have to go with another choice. Bishop back to F4.

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 And he resigned.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Mission accomplished.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:55,000
