00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
 100 rated chess, but enemy pawns have very long weapons, your pieces, not pawns, must never be in

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,320
 a square within 2 tiles in front of an enemy pawn. Very challenging. Developing a knight first is

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,200
 obviously a bad idea because for example knight f3 gets f5 ends the video, knight c3 gets e5 ends

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:29,680
 the video, and same thing with the other 2 moves. Therefore, e4, e5. I still don't want to develop

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,080
 my horsey because it's too risky, d4 is also bad because after he takes, queen takes is just asking

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,240
 him to end my video, and if I don't take he can push d3 the move after and still ends the video.

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,480
 So I guess, f4. I mean there'll be some problems if he decides to take, but based on my Guinness

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,400
 World Record experience about the 100 rated players, I'm pretty sure that he'll give a check.

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:04,800
 Ha! There we go. g3. Queen f6. I'll take this pawn. Alright, now his e-file doesn't have a

10
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,320
 pawn anymore, I now can develop all of my pieces onto the e-file without having to worry about

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:18,640
 anything at all. Queen takes, aha, I really want to go knight c3, but maybe he'll go c5 to end my

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:28,960
 video, therefore, d3. Slow and steady. Bishop e7. Not very aggressive. Knight f3, well I mean now

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:37,600
 f5 immediately ends the video, but who plays like that anyway. Right? Of course, but that move is

14
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,920
 actually not that good for me. So I guess, knight d4, I want him to block one of his remaining

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,280
 pawns with his queen so that I can have another free file to use, and in no world do you push

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,600
 your d-pawn here. That is perfect. Bishop e3. Alright, now with his queen is also blocking

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,360
 his d-pawn, I'm literally having 2 center files to play here, which is to say, that there is

18
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:13,120
 absolutely no chance for him to end my video. c5. Very aggressive. I'll go back. Again, f5 ends the

19
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,560
 video, but since it's just straight up blundering a pawn, there's no way he's gonna play like that.

20
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:27,520
 Right? No doubt. That blunders a pawn. Ha, and with that, I now have one more free file to play with.

21
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:35,440
 f6. I really want to go bishop f4 to gain a tempo, but as you can see, I'm not a fool that end my

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:44,720
 own video. Therefore, bishop e3. Knight h6. Ah ha, that blunders a horsey, but of course I cannot

23
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,400
 take it due to the rules, and since his idea is so obvious that he wants to support his f-pawn to go

24
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,000
 to f5, therefore, bishop h3. Now f5 is no longer available, and since he's hanging his knight over

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,320
 here, it is time that he moves it away. It feels like every single time my opponent makes a move

26
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,440
 that ends my video, Stockfish always has to say "Good."

27
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:28,080
