00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,940
 I love you

3
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:35,940
 I don't say it well

4
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,940
 I'm really clumsy with my words

5
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:47,940
 But, but why

6
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,940
 Did I say goodbye?

7
00:00:54,940 --> 00:01:00,940
 No, no, no, no, no

8
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:06,940
 I love you so much

9
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,940
 No matter how strong the alcohol

10
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:19,940
 It's a distorted memory

11
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:24,940
 I'm a fool

12
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:42,940
 I'm a fool, really a fool

13
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:49,940
 I just believe in you

14
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,940
 I pretend to be a strong woman

15
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,940
 I bathe in the night wind of sadness

16
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:08,940
 Three years have passed since I became alone

17
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,940
 Even the cityscape has changed

18
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,940
 But, but why

19
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,940
 Did I leave only regrets?

20
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,940
 I'm a really bad man

21
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:40,940
 I'll take off the ring of love

22
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,940
 I'll make a fuss

23
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:55,940
 I'm a fool, waiting for you

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,940
 No, no, no, no, no
