00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 100 rated chess, but you're a communist, you must checkmate when you both have equal materials.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,000
 One of the most challenging challenges when put against a 100 rated opponent.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,320
 But I'm not a coward. We get a 115 from Russia. And don't ask me why it is Russia.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:27,280
 E4. E5. Still theory. I mean I can easily checkmate him without making any captures

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:32,800
 to maintain a 0-0 balance in materials, but that way of doing things sounds like what a coward

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,360
 would do and it also ruins the purpose of the challenge. Therefore, D4. I will let the captures

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,960
 happen, and then maneuver the balance of the game when the time is right. D5. A counter gambit.

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:55,120
 I'll take this way. E takes D4. Ah ha. It seems like this guy is trying to mirror my move.

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,080
 So I guess, Q takes D4. Ha. Can't mirror that you i-

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:10,960
 Or you can. But that blunders a queen. Q takes D5, is a great move. Shut up Stockfish.

11
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,320
 Bishop E7. Bishop C4. I'm up 9 points in materials right now,

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,240
 but no worries, we still have a lot of materials to sacrifice.

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,880
 Knight C6. Ah ha. That blunders the F-pawn and will most likely allow a big attack at his king.

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,840
 Therefore, bishop H6. Attacking right now is obviously too early as I'm still being up too

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:46,080
 many points of materials, so let's give him back a few points first. G takes H6. Knight C3.

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,040
 Bishop G4. Ah ha. This guy is trying to prevent me from castling, and you know what? I will take

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,720
 this chance to sacrifice my rook. We'll start the attack immediately if he really decides to take

18
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:10,480
 this rook. Thank you. Here we go. Queen takes F7 check. I mean I'm still being up 2 pawns,

19
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,800
 but that can be fixed in no time. King D7. Bishop E6 king D8 queen G7 should be best as I can

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,040
 continue to win more materials, but I obviously don't want to take anything more. Knight D5.

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:35,040
 I want a quick checkmate. H5. Very aggressive. Knight F3. Somehow I feel like something very

22
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:43,520
 weird is about to happen. Yeah. Like that. Knight D2. I'm trying to get him tunneled

23
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:53,040
 vision into this corner and thus decide to take this pawn. Exactly as planned. A4. One more pawn,

24
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:01,920
 and we're equal. Absolutely. Now we can finally checkmate him. Queen F5. I'm threatening knight

25
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,080
 E4 checkmate in one, and if this 100 rated guy can go bishop C2 putting the bishop back to the

26
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,120
 square that it has just left, I'm down to just resign this game and give him the rating points

27
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:22,480
 that he absolutely deserves. Well I mean he has the idea, just not the correct square. Knight E4.

28
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,600
 Checkmate in the middle of the board. Mission accomplished.

29
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:42,160
