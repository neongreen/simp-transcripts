00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 100 rated chess, but it's bullet hell, whenever any of your pieces or pawns get attacked,

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,320
 their next move must dodge it, they cannot capture if they are being attacked.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,080
 Including pawns into this is making the challenge absolutely impossible. I'll eliminate this part.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,800
 And I'm not a coward. We get a 179 from the US.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,400
 D4. E5. Nothing better than an England gambit against a 100 rated opponent.

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,000
 D takes E5. Knight C6. Knight F3. Still theory.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,200
 Shout out to the beginners out there, this opening is actually very bad for black,

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,520
 so in case you want to be safe and play the game in a more serious way,

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,680
 I would suggest you avoid this opening and learn something a bit more casual.

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,000
 Queen E7. Well, but if you want to have some fun and destroy your opponent quickly,

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,880
 feel free to learn this opening and get destroyed in case your opponent also knows the theory.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:09,600
 Bishop G5. Ah ha, that bishop is attacking my queen, and according to the rules, I have to move

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:20,160
 her. Check. Knight FD2. That blunders a pawn. Knight F3. You have been disconnected, please

14
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,880
 refresh the page to reconnect. No I'm fine thank you. That blunders a rook. I guess we can all

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,480
 easily agree that this guy is not a paid actor, and he's simply just being destroyed by my England

16
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:42,560
 gambit. And thus he decided to also blunder a horsey. Queen D1. Ah ha. His queen is attacking

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:51,440
 my queen, so my woman cannot capture anything, and is also forced to move. C3. That blunders a pawn,

18
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:58,320
 but again, since his pawn is attacking my queen, queen back to B6. I mean a move like queen D7

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,440
 check will be forcing my king to move, but since I have no choice but to capture his queen,

20
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,840
 it will make me look like a fool for ending my own video. But who plays like that anyway? Right?

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,280
 I'm worrying too much. Bishop C5. I mean what can go wrong anyway?

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:27,120
 Queen D5. Wait. That blunders the F pawn with a check, but this queen is attacking two pieces,

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,120
 so which one do I move?

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,560
 What the f-

25
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:47,200
