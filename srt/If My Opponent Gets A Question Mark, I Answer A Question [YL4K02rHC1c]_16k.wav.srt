00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 If your opponent gets a question mark from the engine, you answer a question from the comment section.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,500
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:21,500
 So, basically, my opponent cannot make inaccuracies, mistakes, or blunders.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,500
 Missed wins are fine though.

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,500
 This is going to be short.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,500
 But anyway, let's find an opponent.

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,500
 That was fast.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
 We get a 219 from Hong Kong.

9
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,500
 Wow. I remember that I have met a Hong Kong guy about 2 days ago.

10
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,500
 And now I get another one.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,500
 E4.

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,500
 E5.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
 Nothing too crazy so far.

14
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,500
 To be honest, I would be very surprised if this game lasts longer than move 10.

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,500
 Knight C3.

16
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,500
 Vienna game.

17
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:21,500
 I think that, in order to keep my opponent from making bad moves, I need to sacrifice a lot of material, so that even if he makes a blunder, the advantage that he's having will make Stockfish think that

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,500
 "It's still fine."

19
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,500
 Therefore,

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
 D5.

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,500
 First, I'm sacrificing a pawn.

22
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:44,500
 Stockfish is probably giving me a question mark on this move, but again, the rules only apply on my opponent, so it doesn't matter how bad I play the game.

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,500
 Knight takes D5.

24
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
 I believe that is the best move,

25
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,500
 but of course, let's ask how Stockfish thinks about it.

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
 Of course.

27
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,500
 Next, let's sacrifice a queen.

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,500
 Queen takes D5.

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,500
 He takes D5.

30
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
 Stockfish?

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
 Okay.

32
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:26,500
 Now that he has an entire 7 points lead in material, even if he makes such a horrifying blunder, we will still have some chances of Stockfish forgiving them.

33
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:32,500
 But still, I think that 7 points is not enough.

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,500
 Therefore, let's sacrifice another piece.

35
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:48,500
 After queen takes G4, he will have a +10 material advantage, which is even more than a queen, which should be good for my video.

36
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:54,500
 Bishop B5 check.

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
 Dude!

38
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
 That's like a missed win.

39
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,500
 It allows bishop back to D7, blocking the check.

40
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:14,500
 No worries, because since I have already given him 7 points of material advantage, I think that Stockfish will forgive him this time.

41
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:25,500
 Ha ha! You see? Stockfish even thinks that this is a good move.

42
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:34,500
 Anyway, moving the bishop back is definitely not a plan, because I already planned to sacrifice it.

43
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,500
 Therefore, king D8.

44
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,500
 Now just please take my bishop.

45
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,500
 H3.

46
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 Dude!

47
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,500
 That blunders a queen.

48
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
 But still, let's check Stockfish.

49
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,500
 Man! I'm so nervous I don't even want to check Stockfish.

50
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,500
 I mean can we just ignore this move?

51
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
 No?

52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
 Alright.

53
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:23,500
 Well, let's check the comment section.

54
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
 Wow! Would you look at that!

55
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:37,500
 I was planning to scroll down my comment section and choose the first one that I see, but here we are, already seeing a comment.

56
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,500
 Alan Douglas asking, "First Australian?"

57
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,500
 No.

58
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
 No he's not.

59
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
 He's not.

60
00:04:47,500 --> 00:05:02,500
