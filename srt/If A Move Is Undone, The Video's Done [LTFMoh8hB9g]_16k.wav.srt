1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,760
 If a player makes a move that undoes their previous move, the video ends.

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,760
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,160
 Ha ha.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,080
 This is obviously a big successful challenge.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,600
 I mean who even does that in the first place?

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,920
 We get a 189 from Ukraine.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,280
 E4.

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,280
 Ha ha.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,280
 A pawn move cannot be undone.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,160
 Still, if he moves the other pieces, there is always a very small chance that he's going

11
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,480
 to undo those moves.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,640
 Therefore, I think I should keep him busy.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
 D5.

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,260
 F3.

15
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,880
 Very aggressive.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,800
 D takes E4.

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,800
 Knight C3.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,200
 Ah, now knight back to B1 ends the video.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,280
 But once again, who the heck does that anyway?

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,600
 He takes F3.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,320
 G takes.

22
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,320
 So instead of taking back with his knight, he decided to take back with the G pawn, which

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,200
 also cannot be undone.

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,920
 I mean, yesterday was a devastating loss.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,200
 But today, it's definitely the easiest challenge to be accomplished.

26
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
 E5.

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
 Queen E2.

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,760
 Knight C6.

29
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:33,240
 I bet my entire fortune that queen D1 is not going to happen.

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,040
 D3.

31
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
 Knight F6.

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,720
 Man, I can't express how happy I am every time I see him moving his pawns.

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,600
 Knight H3.

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,440
 I'll take it.

35
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,880
 Bishop takes.

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,480
 Even though I don't think it will happen, bishop F1 is still a threat.

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,920
 Therefore, bishop B4.

38
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,120
 I want to lure his attention towards this side of the board, instead of the other side.

39
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,840
 Bishop D2.

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,600
 Bishop takes C3.

41
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:13,600
 I want to trade down the pieces, since the fewer pieces on the board, the more space

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:20,680
 for the other pieces to move, and the lesser chance that he's going to make weird moves.

43
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
 Bishop takes.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
 Castle.

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,880
 Oh no my pawn.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,160
 Bishop takes E5.

47
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,480
 That blunders a bishop.

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,440
 Queen takes E5.

49
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,200
 That blunders a queen.

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,960
 Rook E8.

51
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:45,960
 And in no world do you move your queen back here.

52
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,400
 Why is he thinking for so long?

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:03:03,960
 What the f-

54
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,800
 Oh no.

55
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,380
 (upbeat music)

56
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,960
 (upbeat music)

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,780
