1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
 100 rated chess, but the number of reactions is how many points of material you have to win.

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,480
 Open parenthesis, exactly, close parenthesis.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,780
 Buy.

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:17,120
 And to make it fair, promotions, do not count toward the challenge.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,200
 Too easy.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,360
 We get a 1 0 5 from America.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,920
 With premium membership.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,200
 There were 27 plus 11 equals 38 total reactions.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,240
 And let us count.

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,320
 8 pawns are 8, 4 minor pieces are 12.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,200
 Rooks are 10, queen is 9, so we have 39 points of total materials able to be captured.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,960
 Which means if I lose 2 pawns or more, the video ends.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,280
 Too easy.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,240
 Since I don't want to lose any material this game.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,380
 E3.

16
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,320
 Knight F6.

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,800
 The original plan was to use only my queen to capture his entire board,

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,200
 but now since he's stopped the threat.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,640
 Bishop C4 instead.

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,660
 D5.

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,560
 Bishop E3.

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,040
 Bishop G4.

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,160
 Blocking with a knight is obviously stupid because if he takes the video immediately ends.

24
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,560
 F3 is kinda forced.

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,800
 Bishop H5.

26
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,680
 If I cannot attack his king side, I'll attack his queen side instead.

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,780
 E6.

28
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,760
 Queen B5 check.

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,280
 Knight C6.

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
 I'll take my first pawn.

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,720
 1 down, 37 more to go.

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,720
 And disclaimer, this playstyle of only moving a woman is not recommended at any rating levels,

33
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,000
 don't try this at home.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,400
 On second thought, maybe do try this at home.

35
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,320
 Queen takes A8.

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,340
 D4.

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,840
 That provokes a trade, which is not good for this video as I can only lose a pawn this

38
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,880
 entire game.

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
 So I'll give a check first.

40
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,820
 C6.

41
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,880
 Now I'll take this pawn.

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,080
 I mean he should be able to see, that taking this pawn is blundering everything left on

43
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,880
 his queen side.

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,180
 Right?

45
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,940
 Frick.

46
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,000
 Queen B8.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,640
 I guess it's fine, I'm allowed to lose a pawn anyway, so all I have to do is to not losing

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,360
 anything else.

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
 Queen D8.

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,880
 Bishop check.

51
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,520
 Knight blocks.

52
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,840
 Queen takes A7.

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,800
 And in no world do you take this pawn.

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,400
 No world.

55
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,240
 No world.

56
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:48,960
 Well even though I haven't managed to reach 38 points yet which means the challenge is

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,640
 not accomplished, the video also didn't end abruptly, so I'll just end it here.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
 So I'll say this is a draw.

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:11,280
