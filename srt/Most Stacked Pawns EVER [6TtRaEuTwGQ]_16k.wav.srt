1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
 I'm better than my viewers, 3 persuasion needle.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,240
 I mean I don't know what a persuasion needle is, but I'm not going to ask.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,960
 Females and males and none of the above, welcome to another I'm better than my viewers video,

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,840
 the series that I have never lost for even a single time after years of making videos,

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,680
 and today's victim is a guy called Karkarki.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,000
 Karki.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,080
 Karkariki.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,560
 That took a while, but I managed.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,560
 One of these pawns is about to promote, but sadly, I can only take one.

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,700
 F pawn changes gender.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,280
 King up queen F3.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,620
 Ah ha, now I have to choose between saving my bishop and getting forked, or avoiding

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,080
 the fork and losing my bishop, and I guess I'll go for, knight D3.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:56,160
 I think I need these pieces alive to keep my king safe, so frack that rook.

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,780
 Knight C7.

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,680
 Queen A4.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,560
 Knight takes D5.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,200
 Bishop takes D5.

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,040
 Trading pieces is probably not a very good idea for this game, but I need some tempos.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,200
 Queen takes D5 bishop E6.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,760
 Queen takes H1.

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
 I'll take this pawn.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,520
 Queen H2 check.

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,840
 King C1.

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,720
 This is getting very difficult for me.

26
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,600
 F3.

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,120
 Very aggressive.

28
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,600
 Queen takes D4.

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,020
 Knight E7.

30
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,280
 Rook takes B6.

31
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,880
 Well, at least I also have a passed pawn.

32
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,660
 Queen takes H3.

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,320
 Even if I try to defend this pawn, he can still bring in more pieces, not to mention

34
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,040
 that he can also check my king and advance his pawns, so I guess, I'll take this pawn

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
 instead.

36
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,800
 I mean who knows, maybe he'll decide to not take this pawn and give me some sort of chance

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,920
 to counterattack.

38
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,080
 Apparently he's not a paid actor.

39
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,520
 And in this position, I see there is no way for me to win this game anymore, so fast forward

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,120
 a little bit, he forced me to trade queens, we traded, pawn push rook F7, and before officially

41
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,200
 resigning the game, I went for.

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,560
 Rook C8.

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
 The plan is very simple.

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,680
 His best plan right now is obviously to turn his H pawn into a woman, but I'm trying to

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,080
 humiliate him by making him get tunneled vision and go for a move like rook B7 trying to defend

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,720
 instead of attacking, which will definitely be the most cowardly move ever existed on

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,240
 this entire channel.

48
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,040
 Ha!

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,620
 Coward.

50
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,040
 And of course after succeeding in humiliating him, I resigned.

51
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,840
 Therefore, I'm better than my viewers, but this guy, even though he is a bit of a coward,

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:56,400
 is equal to me.

53
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,920
