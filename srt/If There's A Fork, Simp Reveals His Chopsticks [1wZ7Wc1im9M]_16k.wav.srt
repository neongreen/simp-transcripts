1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 If there's a fork, Simp reveals his fork.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Well, we actually don't use forks to eat in my country.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 So I'll change that to... chopsticks.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 If there's a fork, I'll reveal my chopsticks.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Alright, let's be real.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 This challenge is way too hard.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 But of course, it's not like I'm afraid of it or something.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Therefore, let's find an opponent.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 That was fast.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 We get a 216 from Hong Kong.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 E4.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 Ah ha. Now he has QG4, forking my G-pawn and my D-pawn.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Or Qh5, forking my H-pawn and my F-pawn.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 And both of them can end the video.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 Of course Nf6 can stop both of them.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 But I don't really want to use my knight, since it's too easy to create a fork with a knight.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And if he just pushes E5, he will remove my knight without any effort at all.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 Therefore, G6.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 I mean let's be real.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 No one plays such a weird move like Qg4.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Right?

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Nh3.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Ah ha.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 He's obviously threatening to go Ng5, forking my H-pawn and my F-pawn, which makes H6 look really good.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 But if I play H6, later on, he may decide to play Bf4,

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 forking my H-pawn and my C-pawn.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Therefore,

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 F6.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 F4.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Very aggressive.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I don't think I want to put my pawns in the center,

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 because they will only be targets for my opponent to create forks.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 So I guess,

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 B6.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 F5.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Again, very, aggressive.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 He's obviously baiting me to move my G-pawn, which blunders checkmate in 1.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And that checkmate also comes with a fork, which really humiliates me,

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 for blundering the game and the video, at the same time.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 So I guess, let's just ignore the king side for now.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 In this position, I really want to play Na6,

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 attempting to trade my knight with his bishop,

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 but sadly, that will allow him to play Bc4,

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 forking my horses, which ends the video.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Therefore,

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Bb7.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Fxg6.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 I'll take that pawn.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 Opening up my rook is really good,

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 because no matter how hard he tries,

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 my rook can never make a fork if it only sees one way straightforward.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Nc3.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Ah ha!

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 He's obviously trying to go Nd5, forking my E and C-pawn,

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 or maybe Nb5, forking my C and A-pawn.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Therefore,

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 C6.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Well, I already saw that move from move 1,

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 so there's not much to say about this.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 So, here are my chopsticks.

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 You may wonder why there are so many,

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 even though I only need to use two.

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 That's because these are all of the chopsticks in my family of three people,

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 and I don't really know which one,

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 or you may say,

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 which two, is mine.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 So, I guessed I would give you guys the entire thing to see.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:45,000
