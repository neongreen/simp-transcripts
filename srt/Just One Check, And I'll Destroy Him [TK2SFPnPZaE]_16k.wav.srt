00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
 100 rated chess, but you move your king until you're put in check.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:12,160
 Ha! Another easy challenge. We get a 100 rated from Argentina, and even though he actually has

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:20,640
 a proper profile picture, I have to hide it away due to various reasons. E4. Well, even though I

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,000
 have to move my king right now, that is obviously against the game's laws, therefore, E5. I mean he

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 still has queen H5 king E7 queen takes E5 checkmate, so if he really plays queen H5 right now, I think

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,440
 I will have to flex and delay moving my king for another move. Ha! Here we go. King E7 is forced.

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:55,600
 Testosterone. Queen H5. Very aggressive. King back to E8 is blundering checkmate in 1, king F6 is

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:03,040
 also blundering queen F5 check king back to E7 queen takes E5 checkmate. Therefore, king D6 is

9
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,720
 kinda forced. I mean if he can just blunder his queen with a check like this, it would be very

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:19,280
 convenient. Of course it doesn't happen. Okay. Now what am I supposed to do? King C5 is blundering

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:27,680
 checkmate in 2, and king C6 is actually also blundering the same checkmate in 2.

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,440
 I mean king C6 is allowing a bishop check instead of queen check, which will be really good for me.

13
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:44,640
 Nevermind. Wow. King B6 is forced. It's fine, as long as he doesn't see queen B5.

14
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,240
 Well since the video is still so short, I will answer some of your comments instead.

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,520
 Why don't we see the actual resignation? The game was played on a different platform from what we

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,200
 usually use for a normal chess game, so I allowed my opponents to resign through a chat message.

17
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:13,920
 What food do you like? I like peanuts, and hate carrots. I'm surprised trying to control the

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,080
 center wasn't one of them, if it was this would have become a lot harder. Actually it was, but I

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,040
 really did not see it that day, so let's just pretend that I did not break the rules.
