00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 100 rated chess, but you move your king, every time your opponent moves his pawn.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:15,040
 Ha! Too easy. We get a 1 41 from India. Since I most likely have to move my king in the early game,

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:24,720
 E4. Let's make room for the fat guy. E5. Okay. Here we go. King E2. It's all good,

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,240
 this is obviously expected by everyone watching this video. Okay I did not expect that. Queen takes

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:44,720
 E4 is checkmate in 1, therefore, knight C3. Queen G4 check. F3. Go away you woman. Queen E6. Aha!

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,440
 Knight to D5. I'm threatening knight takes E7 royal family fork, which means he cannot move

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:01:00,880
 his pawns right now. Unless he can. Wow! That blunders a queen, but sadly, I have to move my

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,720
 king. It's fine, there is a chance that he won't take. Nevermind. And even worse, that is a pawn

9
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,800
 move. Therefore, king E2 is kinda forced. This is going very wrong very quickly. D takes E4.

10
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:23,360
 Another pawn move, and at this point, that pawn is gonna go all the way down to change his gender

11
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:31,200
 and there is nothing I can do about it. Therefore, king F2. The plan is E takes F3 and king takes F3

12
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:41,840
 to stop the danger. Bishop C5 check. King back to E2. E takes F3 check. Oh no! Now if I take that

13
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:50,240
 pawn, there is queen F5 king G3 bishop F2 checkmate in 2, or queen F5 king E2 queen E4 also

14
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:57,920
 checkmate in 2. This easy challenge is getting much harder than it was supposed to be. King E1

15
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,240
 is kinda forced. Oh wow, now I see even king E1 is also blundering F2 check king E2 queen G4 king

16
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:14,640
 D3 queen D4 king E2 queen E4 checkmate in 4. Well it's not like he can see that anyway. No way!

17
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:23,920
 No, I don't believe, that was just a lucky move. King E2 is forced. F pawn changes gender.

18
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,680
 The situation is really bad, but let's be positive that at least he didn't checkmate me.

19
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,600
 But anyway, a promotion is also a pawn move. Therefore, king to D3. I mean king E1 was

20
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,720
 blundering queen F2 mate, so I went king D3 even though it's not that much better.

21
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:50,560
 He takes my rook. Aha! Now I can finally play the game normally. I need to make room for the

22
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,400
 D pawn to take the center, therefore, king E2. Man, now I realize that even though I said I can

23
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,240
 play the game, it's still a king move. Queen G4 check. Now every move is blundering a checkmate

24
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:14,320
 in some ways. King E1. Oh no, is he gonna take my queen to force king takes and queen F1 checkmate?

25
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:23,040
 Wait what? So this guy did not see the checkmate in 2, but instead went for bishop F2 check,

26
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,400
 which distracts my king away from defending my queen, and then he can win my queen for free.

27
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,920
 How the f*** can a 100 rated guy know about this distracting stuff? I didn't even know about that

28
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,560
 stuff until I was around 1300, and here comes a 100 rated guy totally destroying me right now

29
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:52,400
 with such strategy. You know what? I'm not gonna continue this video anymore,

30
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,360
 there is no way I can win this game even if I ignore the mission and play seriously.

31
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,240
 Thank you for watching, and mission is failed.
