00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 If your opponent sacrifices a knight or a bishop, the video ends.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:13,600
 Well, I think this mission is actually pretty easy, so let's just say that I won't move my

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:20,080
 queen out before move 10. You know, because if I can just sacrifice my queen for 2 pieces,

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,160
 the mission will become impossible to lose. Let's go. We get a 2 77 from the US.

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:39,600
 E4. E5. Still theory. Knight F3. Queen F6. Very aggressive. And by the way, even though most

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:47,120
 people think developing a queen first is bad, chess.com actually says, book move. I'm very

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:58,400
 curious to see the guy who wrote that book. But anyway. Knight C3. Bishop C5. Knight D5. Bishop

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:08,800
 back to D6. Not very aggressive. That blunders a queen. G takes F6. Ha, I was thinking knight takes,

9
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,160
 but pawn takes is actually even better for me, because if he doesn't develop his pieces,

10
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:24,080
 the less chance that he's gonna blunder them. D4. C5. Aha, taking this pawn should be the best move,

11
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,200
 but that will make my pawn attack his bishop, which may lead to him blundering his bishop,

12
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,800
 which ends the video. So I guess, bishop C4, I mean if I don't attack him, he doesn't blunder.

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:47,680
 Right? Knight C6. Aha, he's obviously provoking D5 attacking his knight, but after D5,

14
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,120
 he may be going to blunder his knight, which ends the video. Therefore, D takes E5, since he has

15
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:02,960
 3 pieces. Well I mean 2 pieces and 1 pawn, attacking E5, there is no way he's blundering his bishop

16
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:12,000
 now. Right? Of course. Well, technically that still blunders his bishop this way, but since

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,440
 I said that I won't move my queen out before move 10, it's actually not a blunder. Knight G5,

18
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:30,960
 let's try to do something fun. Bishop E7. That blunders a rook. B5. Very aggressive. Bishop D5.

19
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:41,360
 Knight F6. I'll take his rook. This mission is going very smoothly. Knight takes D5. Aha,

20
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,120
 trading is good, because the fewer minor pieces he has, the less chance he's gonna blunder them.

21
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,040
 But anyway, taking with the pawn should be the best move, but that will make my pawn attack his

22
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,160
 knight, which may cause him to blunder his knight on the next move. Therefore, queen takes D5.

23
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:05,760
 Now since my queen can come out, I'm confident to say that there's no way I'm gonna lose this

24
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,840
 mission, after I can sacrifice my queen for 2, or actually, just 1 minor piece. Or even better,

25
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,640
 there's a chance that he's just gonna resign the game. Right. Now.

26
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,080
 What the f-

27
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,560
