00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 100 rated chess, but you make 5 moves before revealing the challenge. Since I've already

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,520
 attempted a challenge like this before, we can already see that this one is going to be absolutely

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:21,600
 terrifying. But of course, I'm not a coward. We get a 142 from the Philippines. E4. E5. It's

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,240
 actually pretty bad that I'm playing black because for most of the time I will have to respond to my

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:34,240
 opponent in the first 5 moves. But that's life. Knight F3. Ah ha, since I'll have to open the

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:41,360
 challenge after 5 moves, the best plan is obviously to win the game before that. So I guess, knight F6.

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,480
 Stafford Gambit time. Perfect. Knight C6. I've seen a lot of people just retreat their knight

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,080
 in this position, but I believe that this good looking guy is not one of those cowards. Right?

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:03,520
 Bishop takes will be blocking my queen, and since I don't know what the challenge is yet,

10
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,720
 it's better to make sure that my queen will be able to move. I mean if he can also blunder

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,880
 his queen just before the challenge starts. That will be very convenient.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:22,560
 Well. Very convenient. Queen takes. And I mean if he can also resign right now just before I

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,080
 get to open the challenge, I will be very grateful. Sadly he's not a paid actor. Let's

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,600
 see what the challenge has to offer. Your pieces can only go backwards, not pawns.

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,200
 Absolutely f***ing impossible. Queen E6. Since my pieces cannot go forward anymore,

16
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,120
 it's best to leave them somewhere that won't block away the path of the pawns.

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:58,400
 Bishop B5. G5. Bishop C4. Ah ha. That blunders a bishop, but sadly,

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,400
 I have to retreat my queen. In no world do you take this pawn and force me to end my own video.

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,000
 Well, since the video is still so short, I'll answer some of your comments instead.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,920
 Short answer, you are lazy. Lazy people do nothing in their free time, but as I said,

21
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,160
 I do watch videos in my free time, so I'm obviously not lazy.

22
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,920
 It is said that the best swordsman in Spain does not fear the second best swordsman,

23
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,800
 but does fear the worst. I disagree, he'd better be scared of those with guns.

24
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,080
 20th day saying the old music was better until Symp changes it back.

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,360
 That's one more comment per video for me.
