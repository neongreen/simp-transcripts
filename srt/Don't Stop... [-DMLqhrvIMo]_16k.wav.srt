1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,760
 If a pawn is stopped, the video is stopped. Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,000
 I normally don't take challenges that depend on luck. But you know, I'm pretty much out of ideas.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,480
 Therefore, let's go. We get a 1 45 from Ireland. Pushing center pawns is obviously not a great

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:30,640
 idea. Therefore, G3. Now knight C6 or knight F6 ends the video, because they stop the movement

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:40,000
 of these pawns. But you know, there's nothing I can do about that. A5. Well, I guess that's lucky,

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,640
 since the video can last a bit longer. Now A4 is the threat, because it can come with A3,

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:58,000
 which stops my A pawn, which ends the video. Therefore, B3. H5. Very aggressive. Bishop G2.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,920
 I mean I already have a pawn on G3, so no need to worry about H4. And H4 happens anyway. Now H3

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:16,240
 ends the video, since it stops my H2 pawn. Therefore, G takes H4 is kinda forced. And in

10
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:25,280
 no world do you play rook H5 here. Thank you. Now knight F3 attacking the rook should be really good.

11
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,320
 But of course, that makes me a fool, for ending my own video. Therefore, bishop B2.

12
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:42,080
 A4. Man this guy is really aggressive. B takes A4. Alright, just take it please,

13
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:50,400
 with any rooks you want. Perfect. D3. And in no world do you play rook D4 here.

14
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:58,240
 Rook KB4. Attacking the rook with one of these moves looks really fun. But once again,

15
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:09,440
 I can't just end my own video. Queen C1. Rook HG4. Yeah, I saw that was coming. King F1.

16
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:21,440
 Rook B5. Knight D2. Rook BG5. Very aggressive. Now knight E4 is obviously the best move,

17
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,400
 but it will just provoke rook G6, which stops the G pawn, which ends the video. So I guess.

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,160
 Bishop E4. I mean things may get real bad if he plays F5 here. But what else can I do anyway.

19
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:46,560
 And he found it. Well, I guess we have no other choice. H3. Of course rook H4 ends the video,

20
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,320
 but let's just hope that he sees knight F3 forking the rooks, and then plays rook F4 instead.

21
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:03,520
 Aha, perfect. And by the way, that rook didn't stop his F pawn. Knight C4. F takes E4.

22
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:14,800
 Queen takes F4, and in no world do you play E3 here. E5. Knight takes E5. Now just don't see

23
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:23,760
 anything and blunder your king. E takes D3. Wow. I can't believe I've actually won that challenge.

24
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,640
 Queen F7. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

25
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:45,280
