 100 rated chess, but you hate sharp objects, if any of your pieces, not pawns, are forked,

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:15,280
 pinned, or skewered. The video ends. Ha, like I'm gonna let the 100 rated people do that to me.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:26,960
 We get a 194 from the United Kingdom. E4. E5. Still theory. D4. G6. Not very aggressive.

4
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,800
 I'll take this pawn. C6. I want to develop this knight, but then he can go Bb4 pinning my knight

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:44,080
 to my king, which ends the video, so I guess, Bc4. B6. This guy is just moving random pawns.

6
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,400
 Knight F3. Bb4 check. Very aggressive. Blocking with a piece will make his bishop pinning my

7
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,640
 piece into my king. Therefore, I have to block with a pawn. I mean technically speaking, he is

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,320
 pinning my pawn into my king, but if you look at the challenge again, it only applies to pieces,

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,120
 not pawns, so pinning a pawn is definitely not breaking the rules of the challenge.

10
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:18,320
 Bc5. Bg5. I mean if he goes Qf6 right now, he'll be pinning my knight into my F pawn,

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,560
 which ends the video because a knight is a piece, but since that move is obviously

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:31,760
 blundering a woman, there's no way he's playing like that. Right? Of course. I'll take that pawn.

13
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:40,320
 Still, in no world do you take with your queen here. Of course. But that blunders a horsey.

14
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,640
 E5. Rf8. Ah ha, he moved his rook to avoid me taking his knight with my bishop which forks his

15
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,160
 queen and his rook, which is to say, that at least he can see one move ahead of the current position.

16
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,560
 I'll take this knight, since he can see ahead of the position,

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,400
 I guess we can safely say that he won't just take this pawn carelessly.

18
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:23,680
