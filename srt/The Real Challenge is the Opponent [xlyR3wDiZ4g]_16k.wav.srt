00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 100 rated chess, but you have to win with lower accuracy than your opponent.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,680
 Dude. Here's the thing. I cannot know what my accuracy is during the game,

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,960
 so how am I supposed to know if I'm doing well or not?

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,280
 Well, I guess we'll figure it out. We get a 250 rated American.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,840
 E4, the challenge has two things to do. Win. And play badly.

6
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,960
 To be honest, I don't think those two things do go together very often.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,160
 E5. Still theory. It's time for my first low accuracy move of the game.

8
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,240
 B4. B4 is literally the worst opening move on the chessboard at move 2,

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,600
 so there is no way he can make an even worse move right now.

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,920
 Is this guy trying to prove that I'm wrong?

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,000
 I'll take it. I'm pretty sure the best move was A3 to protect the B pawn,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
 so taking his pawn should definitely be a bad move.

13
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,320
 Knight F6. Aha, that is 100% the best move, which is good for the challenge.

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,840
 Knight F3. E4 is best, and it is very easy to see my man.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,800
 Perfect. The plan is simple. I make the best move very easy to see,

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,440
 so that he can have higher accuracy than I do.

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,440
 Bishop C4. Alright, now just take my knight and we both can be happy.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,480
 No. That's the wrong move. Castle. Let's try again.

19
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:46,640
 F***. So every time I blunder my knight, my accuracy is low, but every time he misses my

20
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,480
 free knight, his accuracy goes to the trash can, because Stockfish really hates miss wins.

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,160
 Knight C3. Third time's a charm.

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,720
 Nevermind. I guess I have to move my knight to avoid him further destroy his own accuracy.

23
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:10,240
 Knight G5. I mean knight D4 bishop G6 knight E6 was obviously the best continuation,

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,600
 so knight G5 was kinda forced, and it also provokes D5 blocking the fork, which is very easy to see.

25
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,960
 That blunders a fork. Dude. It seems like this guy is willingly playing all the bad moves on

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,280
 the board for some reason. Rook E1. I obviously could not go for the fork for the sake of the

27
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:41,920
 challenge, and now please just play D5. This guy is really destroying me right now.

28
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:48,320
 It's fine, I mean he's blundering a fork, so why not use my bishop instead.

29
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,640
 Ok, only 2 choices. King E7 maintains the king on the same file with the rook, which is bad,

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,360
 and king D7 moves the king away from my pieces, away from the rook,

31
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,000
 and also dodges a future knight D5 check, which is obviously the better move.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:18,160
 Are you serious? Alright, how about this. Knight takes E4, a trade is very likely to happen,

33
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,880
 and rook takes E4 is a check, so he has to go king D7, because king F6 is obviously blundering

34
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:32,160
 checkmate in 3 of queen F3 check king takes G5 is forced E4 check king H4 queen H3 checkmate.

35
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,200
 Well, I can't even say that resigning is a bad decision.

36
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,400
 But anyway, let's just see the accuracy so we can have the official result.

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
 Yeah. I can see that coming.

38
00:03:49,680 --> 00:04:04,320
