00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 100 rated chess, but you have to mimic your opponent every second move.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,600
 I feel so bad taking on a challenge from a guy that is timed out.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,800
 But who cares anyway. We get a 129 from the Philippines.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:19,440
 And in case you're wondering if I'm gonna unmute that guy after the recording,

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,120
 no chance.

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,160
 E4. I don't have to mimic him on my first move, but the best move is still

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,800
 E5.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,400
 Qf3.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,520
 Alright, now the challenge officially begins, Qf6 is forced.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,560
 Trading queens with a 100 rated opponent is not really an optimal decision,

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,880
 but it's fine.

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,480
 Nh3.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,040
 Okay now that is even more problematic as he may decide to take my queen on his

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,080
 next turn and I cannot make a mimicking move.

15
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,520
 So I guess, I have to move her somewhere else.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
 A random knight move or queen move here ends the video,

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,640
 but since he has already put his queen on a very good square and there is no

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,360
 safe square for his knight to advance forward.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,400
 Of course those pieces won't be moving this move,

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,680
 and there is also no way he's randomly moving his king sideway.

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,920
 Right?

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,200
 No doubt.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,920
 D6 is forced.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,520
 Ng5.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,160
 I'll have to copy his next move, and since he's just moved his king's knight,

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,520
 big chance he's not moving it again, Nf6.

27
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,200
 D4.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
 D5 is forced.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,000
 Pawn moves are very dangerous as they are not very flexible for me to adapt,

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,160
 for example this capture is insane as I won't dare to capture back as it will

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,680
 provoke him to move his queen and I cannot mimic that.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,200
 Nevermind.

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,360
 I don't have to mimic, but since he may want to move this pawn again,

34
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,240
 E takes D4.

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,520
 D6.

36
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
 I saw that was coming, D3 is forced.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,440
 D takes C7.

38
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,840
 Alright, now the situation gets very complicated.

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,560
 If I take this pawn, C D8 is a check and I cannot mimic that move,

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,360
 but if I take this pawn, queen takes or pawn takes also ends the video,

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,240
 and if I just make a random queen move, a promotion is also not copyable,

42
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,360
 so after a while thinking about the position,

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,600
 I took this pawn anyway.

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,880
 Bishop takes, please.

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,320
 Thank you.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,600
 Bishop D6 is forced.

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,880
 D3.

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,320
 I don't have to mimic that move, but in this position,

49
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,000
 something unexpected happened.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,320
 He offered a draw.

51
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,480
 Draw accepted.

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,680
 Mission accomplished, and I'm not a coward.

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:10,240
