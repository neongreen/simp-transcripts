00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
 100 rated chess, but you cut the break wires, rooks, bishops and queen can only stop by bumping

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,960
 into a piece, or pawn, or the edge of the board. I think I've done something similar to this before,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,000
 but since I don't remember when that was or how that turned out, it's totally fine to start

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,600
 another attempt. e4. e5. The pawns are not affected by the challenge, but of course it is totally

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:33,120
 fine to just move the pawns the furthest they can travel. d4. I'll take it. Opening up the board may

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,480
 not be the greatest idea because those pieces will have too many squares to move, but of course,

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:46,800
 I'm not a coward. Qxxe6. I mean if he can just blunder his queen and then immediately resign

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:55,520
 after that, it will be very convenient. Qc3. Ah ha, that actually also blunders the queen to bishop

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,320
 b4 skewering the royal couple, but sadly, according to the rules, my bishop can only go to a3 touching

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:11,840
 the wall, and cannot be stopped at b4, so I guess. d5. f3. That blunders the queen again, but again,

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,680
 I can only take this pawn. fxe4. That once again blunders the same queen, and you know what,

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,200
 I'm down to say that he's just gonna blunder his woman for the rest of the game. Qh4 check.

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,920
 Touching the wall. g3. I'll take this pawn. Alright, as I said before, he's gonna blunder

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,280
 his queen for the rest of this game, so let's see if he is able to find queen e3 blocking the check

15
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,640
 and also pin my queen to my king so my queen cannot take his rook in the corner. He couldn't.

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,760
 I'll take the rook. Bumping into a piece and the edge of the board at the same time.

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:01,120
 Bishop f3. Aha, that bishop forks my queen and my knight which threatens bishop c6 bc6 queen c6

18
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:08,400
 forking my king and rook, but sadly, I can bump into this horsey. Man, maybe this challenge is

19
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:22,240
 actually easier than I expected. Resignation. Mission accomplished.
