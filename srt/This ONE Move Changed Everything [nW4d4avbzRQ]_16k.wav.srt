1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
 Bet simp can't defeat this woman. How dare you underestimate me. 100 rated chess, but opponent's

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:13,280
 queen is a charming Aphrodite. All pieces. And pawns, while in her vision will fall in love and

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,960
 cannot capture her. I have no idea how he can possibly think that such an easy challenge can

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,440
 get the better of me. Let's show this guy who's the boss here. We get a 1 0 2 from the Philippines.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,480
 The core of the challenge is just to win my opponent's queen, because if I can win his queen,

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,760
 the rest of the game should be easy as I only have to play normal chess. So I guess. F4. Opening up

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:45,520
 this diagonal has a bait for his woman to come out. Unless he decides to keep her in. E4. A gambit

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:55,680
 should also be good. D takes E4. Knights E3. E3. That blunders a pawn, but since my D pawn is in

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:06,240
 his queen's vision, I cannot take it. E takes D2 check. Bishop takes D2. E5. That blunders another

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:15,040
 pawn, and I'll take with my horsey. Bishop G4. Ah ha. I cannot move my queen because she is standing

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,240
 in the opposite woman's vision, but of course I can move my horsey. Bishop E4. I don't want to

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,680
 lose my knights because they are the only ones that can capture my opponent's queen. Therefore,

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,280
 knight E4. Knight F6. That unfortunately forks my knights, so even though I really don't want

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,520
 to do this, I have to let one die. G takes F6. There's a free bishop here, but once again,

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,760
 since my bishop is in his queen's vision, I cannot do that. I mean who knows, maybe he'll feel bad

16
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:57,600
 for me and decide to keep his bishop there so that I can take it on my next move. Right? Well,

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:07,520
 very generous. Knight takes B4. That blunders a horsey, but you know how it is. Bishop C4. I can

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,680
 already see, that this challenge is going to be the cleanest victory of my entire channel. You

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,800
 have been disconnected, please refresh the page to reconnect. No I'm fine thank you. Queen D4.

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:30,400
 Wait. That queen has just completely stunned my whole army. A3. I don't know, just wanted to make

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,960
 a move, and somehow I feel really bad about this video now. Queen takes E4 check. I cannot move my

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,320
 king due to the rules, I cannot block with this bishop due to the rules, I cannot block with my

23
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:49,040
 queen because a queen trade will immediately end the video as it is literally a checkmate according

24
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,920
 to the rules. So I guess, bishop E3 is kinda forced. It's fine, I can block with the other

25
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:05,120
 bishop after he takes this one. But unless he magically finds the best move. Wow. I still cannot

26
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:14,960
 move my king due to the rules, queen takes C2 is forced. Please take this bishop. Well, the challenge

27
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:20,880
 only requires me to take his queen, so now since I have lost my queen before I'm able to do that,

28
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,960
 I hereby admit my defeat as a real man. Have a great day.

29
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:39,280
