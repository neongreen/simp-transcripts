1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 It's April Fool's Day, so why not go for...

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,600
 100 rated chess.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,120
 But I lie to my opponent.

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,760
 And who the hell is Elis?

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,640
 But anyway, we get a 100 rated simp from Kuwait.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,640
 The plan is simple.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,200
 I try my best to trick him to resign, and if he can survive my lies until move 10, the mission is failed.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,960
 E4.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,600
 I will start telling my lies from move 2.

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,760
 E5.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,980
 Yeah.

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,240
 Here we go.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,960
 Hi, I'm a girl.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,320
 Can you let me win please?

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,020
 Ha!

16
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,080
 Now just resign you simp.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,300
 D4.

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,060
 No.

19
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,960
 Ah ha.

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,440
 So he is playing hard to get now isn't he?

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,080
 E takes D4.

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,440
 To make things look real, I will tell a lie every two moves,

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,200
 so that he won't think that I'm just trying to get free rating points.

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,500
 C3.

25
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,400
 D3.

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,020
 He's trying to give back his pawn, but before that...

27
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,700
 I'm single, and I can give you my phone number.

28
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,020
 Bishop takes D3.

29
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,860
 I don't want.

30
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,400
 Wow.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,380
 A very tough guy ha.

32
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,860
 Bishop C5.

33
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,460
 Knight F3.

34
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,140
 No worries.

35
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,300
 I'm very confident that he will immediately resign after my next lie.

36
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,780
 Queen F6.

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,460
 All right.

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,380
 Let's see if he can resist to this.

39
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,860
 We can go on a date.

40
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,380
 Question mark.

41
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,720
 E5.

42
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,300
 Oh wow.

43
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,300
 He doesn't reply anymore, so I guess he's really thinking about it.

44
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,820
 But anyway.

45
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,060
 That blunders a queen.

46
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:54,740
 I mean since he's already blundered a queen, maybe he'll also decide to resign right now.

47
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,900
 Nevermind.

48
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,340
 All right.

49
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,940
 It's time for me to pull out my strongest weapon.

50
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,620
 Oh please.

51
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,780
 I just want to have a boyfriend to teach me how to play chess.

52
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,480
 Bonus.

53
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,700
 A crying emotes.

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,320
 Ha.

55
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,540
 Let's see how he can resist that.

56
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,540
 King takes F2.

57
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,380
 The mission only lasts until before move 10, so the next move is pretty much all I have.

58
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,540
 Knight H6.

59
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,840
 Wow.

60
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,820
 He still doesn't reply.

61
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,980
 I'll take that knight.

62
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,260
 This is the last move, so please just res-

63
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,760
 Mission.

64
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,260
 Failed.

65
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:55,060
