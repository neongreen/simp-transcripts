00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 100 rated chess, but you are Robin Hood, you can only take a piece. Or pawn, if it is 3 tiles away, or further.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Ha! It has been a long time since the last time I get to say "or pawn", but anyway.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Very challenging. We get a 101 American.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 E4.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 E5.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 D4. The plan is to open up the board real fast so that my pieces can have more squares to move around.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 Perfect. I normally will just lay C3 and go for the Danish Gambit, but after D takes C3 Bishop C4 C takes B2,

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I cannot take his pawn because my bishop is only 1 square away from the pawn, and as you have already known,

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 1, is less than 3, which means that pawn will continue to take my rook and then change his gender.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 So I guess, queen takes D4.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 Bishop E7. That blunders a pawn, and as you can see, 1, 2, 3, and 3, is not less than 3, therefore, I can take it.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Bishop back to F8. Ah ha! That blunders a rook, but sadly, the rook is only 1 square away from my queen, which is less than 3,

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 so I guess, queen back to C3. I'm moving my queen away to gain some distance, because you know, big chances that he will blunder his rook again.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Or his bishop. Queen takes G7. That was a 4 square distance, and if I remember correctly,

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 4, is not less than 3, therefore that move was possible.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Queen E7. That blunders the rook again, and again, I cannot take it right now.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Queen back to C3 again, and I did not blunder Edward, I need him dead so that my pieces can have more space to move around.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Edward is dead. Who cares, bishop E3.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 Queen E6. Ah ha, now that really blunders the rook. Man my queen just hippity hoppity all over around his territory.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 And I absolutely don't know what that move is.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Wow! That blunders a horsey, but once again, the rules are destroying all the fun.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Knight C3. My horses are actually useless in this game because their move length is square root of 5, which is approximately 2.236,

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 which is less than 3, but I still need to develop the knight so that I can use my rook.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 King retreats. Not very aggressive. Long castle.

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Queen E8. Bishop? No.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 Rook E1. I was planning to go bishop H6 king E7 rook E1 skewering the royal couple, but let's be a bit more greedy and go for a checkmate in one threat.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Ha, he's obviously baiting me to take his pawn so that he can win my rook, but sadly, that is actually a check, so that plan is just blundering a queen, but anyway.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Bishop to H6. Checkmate.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Mission accomplished.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:33,000
