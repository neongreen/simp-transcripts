00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 100 rated chess, but you are religious, you need to promote 3 or more pawns into bishops,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,000
 you cannot let any bishops die, and every piece, not pawn, has to visit your bishops before they

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,520
 die. The last part just doesn't make any sense, so I'll say that we'll just gonna delete away

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,840
 that entire section. And I'm not a coward. We get a 1 34 from Argentina. Ha, I'm very sorry

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:35,360
 about your defeat against Saudi Arabia. E4. E5. Still theory. D4. Since the challenge doesn't

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,320
 allow me to trade down my bishops, the best plan is obviously to quickly open up the board,

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,960
 and then give my bishops a lot of activity without having to move them around for too many times.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,720
 D5. Bayer Gambit. I'll take this pawn, a resignation means the challenge is failed,

9
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:58,800
 but since I've only taken a pawn, there is absolutely no reason to resign right now. Right?

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:08,400
 No doubt. That blunders a woman, but of course, I don't dare to take it. Again, I'm not a coward,

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,440
 this is just the most logical way to continue this video. Bishop E4. Blocking with a knight

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,680
 is just provoking him to take, which is not good because I cannot recapture. Therefore, C3.

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,600
 Bishop E7. That still blunders the queen, but I'll take the pawn instead.

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,280
 Queen H4. That blunders the queen for the third time, but bishop D3 instead. It's fine,

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,040
 as long as he doesn't take this pawn and force me to take his queen,

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:49,280
 there is absolutely nothing that can go wrong. Are you serious? King takes F2 is forced.

17
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,440
 Alright, I mean since he is the one forcing me to take his queen,

18
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,960
 there's no reason to resign the game right now. Right?

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:05,760
 Of course. I cannot take that bishop due to the rules, so king G1. I'm trapping my own rook to

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:11,680
 somewhat make him feel better after losing his woman. And in no world do you play bishop F2 right

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:20,320
 now. I'm worrying too much. C4. Alright, now we know that he's not the type of player who

22
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,920
 just randomly resigned from the game, I'm down to say that this challenge is definitely a success.

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,720
 What the f-
