00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 If an equal trade of pieces, not pawns, happens, the video ends.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 Well, I think that I have already done something like this in the past.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But of course, I can't argue with money.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Therefore, let's find an opponent.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 That took quite some time.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 We get a 400 rated from Brazil.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 E4.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 E5. Nothing special.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 Knight F3.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 Ah ha! Now if I play knight C6, he will get a big chance to play bishop B5,

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 which will force me to move my knight again, since he may decide to take it next turn.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 Knight F6 also doesn't look good, because after knight takes E5, D6, knight F3,

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 knight takes E4, queen E2, queen E7, D3, knight back to F6, queen takes E7 forces me to take the queen back,

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 which is a trade, and therefore ends this video.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 So I guess, my only choice that makes sense is,

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 D6.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Bishop C4.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Knight F6.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 I'm trying to get him to play knight G5, which looks like fried liver.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 But then I have D5, E takes D5, and since the white pawn on D5 doesn't have a knight to attack,

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I can play bishop D6, which makes his bishop gets blocked by his own pawn.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Knight C3.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 He saw it.

36
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Bishop G4.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 Developing my light square bishop first, which allows me to play knight D7,

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 since knight C6 is just ending my own video.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Knight takes E5.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Very aggressive.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Right at the moment that I pinned down his knight, he moved his knight to prove that

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I didn't pin anything.

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 But anyway,

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 that blunders a queen.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Bishop takes F7 check.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 I thought he was planning something like knight takes F7, but this is actually even better for me.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Alright then.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 King E7 is forced.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 Knight D5 check.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 Wait.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 I think I understand now.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 He thought that after bishop takes F7, king E7, knight D5 is checkmate,

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 and totally missing my knight on F6.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 But the worst thing is, now he's forcing me to play knight takes D5,

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 and then he can take my knight back, which makes me a fool, for ending my own video.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Are you serious?

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Okay.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Alright.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 It's fine.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 There are still chances, that he won't take back the knight, or take the bishop,

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 because taking the bishop is also counted as a trade.

62
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Knight takes D5 is forced.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Please don't take back

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 my knight.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 I hate this guy.
