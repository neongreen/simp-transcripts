00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 100 rated chess, but your queen loves violence, she must see every capture, and if your queen

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,160
 is captured then the video ends. Another impossible challenge, but of course, maybe I'll get some luck.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:24,560
 We get a 189 from the US. E4. Ah ha, so the most popular respond to E4 is E5, but if I play E5,

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,480
 my queen won't be able to see my E pawn dies in case my opponent just randomly takes it.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,960
 Therefore, I'll push David instead. I'm sorry David, but you need to die for the video's sake.

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:46,080
 David is dead. My queen obviously saw that murder, so the video continues. Queen takes D5.

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,760
 And of course the queen sees whatever capture that she delivers herself.

8
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,160
 D4. Knight C6. Now he cannot play knight C3 anymore because it blunders a pawn, and with my

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,360
 queen in the middle of the board, I'll have an easier time navigating my queen to see all of the

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:14,720
 captures in the future. C3. Bishop F5. Queen F3. Ah ha, that forks my queen and my bishop, and since

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,440
 my queen is not allowed to die according to the rules, bishop E4 is kinda forced. I mean bishop

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:26,720
 C4 will be pretty problematic because I cannot let my queen dies or take his bishop and cut my

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,320
 queen's vision towards my bishop, but he should be able to see, that bishop C4 is obviously

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:42,560
 blundering a bishop to bishop F3 bishop D5 bishop D5. Right? He saw it. I'll take this pawn then.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,400
 In no world do you take this pawn right now just to end my video.

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:54,000
 No doubt. That blunders a woman, but since my queen won't be able to see the capture,

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,400
 I cannot take her due to the rules. Knight F6. It's fine, at least he won't be able to

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:08,240
 end my video right now, regardless of how hard he tries to do so. Queen F4. He's trying to target

19
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,400
 this pawn, and since my queen doesn't see the capture, I have to prevent that. And again,

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,080
 now queen takes F6 ends the video because my queen can no longer see my knight being captured,

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
 but I mean who plays like that anyway. Right?

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:30,560
 Why is he thinking for so long?

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:40,240
 Ha! You know what they say. Always have faith in the 100 rated players. Now I can go bishop C5

24
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:46,800
 baiting him to take my G pawn which blunders queen F2 king D1 I B4 bishop C2 a very obvious

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,560
 to see and unstoppable checkmate in 3, but since my queen won't be able to see his queen taking my

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,400
 G pawn, I'll have to end the video even before starting to deliver the checkmate. So I guess,

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,880
 bishop C2 instead. The idea is much more simple. He moves his knight, I checkmate in 1.

28
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,480
 Or he can just abandon the game and give me a free win.

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,680
 Wow. That was very convenient.

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:30,080
