1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 100 rated chess, but you have to move the same piece.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Or pawn.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 As your opponent did last move.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Alright, this is obviously not doable.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 But still, there's no way I'm scared of it.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Let's find an opponent.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 [Music]

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 We get a 235 from Uruguay.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 E4.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Well, a pawn move.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 D5.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 D4.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 I'll take it.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 So far so good.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Queen takes.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Alright, a queen move.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 I would love to play queen F6, queen takes F6, knight takes F6.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 But of course, after queen takes F6, I will have to make a queen move, and since my queen is already dead,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 the mission is failed.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Therefore, queen E7 is kinda forced.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 King D1.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Ok dude.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 King D8 is forced.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Things are going very wrong very quickly.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Knight F3.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 Thank you.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Knight C6.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Queen C4.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Moving my queen up is too risky, since if she is attacked by another piece, she can't move.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 So I guess, queen E8 is kinda forced.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 And with that, I have castled my king with his queen.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 Bishop G5 check.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Normally, F6 would be the best move, but of course, bishop E7 is forced.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Please just take my bishop and end this quickly, this is like a torture to me.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 H4.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 Oh he wants to play.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 F6.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 Bishop F4.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 I want to go bishop B4, but it's very likely that he's going to play C3 after that, which wins my bishop, since I'll have to move a pawn.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 Therefore, bishop F8 is kinda forced.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 G4.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 Very aggressive.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 A6.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 G5.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Again, very, aggressive.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 B5.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Queen D5.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Queen E7 is kinda forced.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 H5.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Man! This dude has been moving his pawns and his queen for like 80% of the game.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 H6.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 G takes H6.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 I want to play G5, but there's a chance that he knows about the French move, which would be really bad.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Therefore, G takes is kinda forced.

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 C4.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 Another pawn move.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 I'll take it.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 Queen takes.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 Man! This guy is like, if I don't move my pawns, I'll move my queen.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 But anyway, queen E8 is kinda forced.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 I feel like I'm literally torturing myself for taking this mission.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Knight A3.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Yes!

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 Finally, he moved another piece.

65
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 Knight E7 then.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 Bishop H3.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Bishop G7.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 I don't have many choices anyway.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Rook G1.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 Rook G8.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Everything is going as planned.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 Knight B5.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 Okay that's not in the plan.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 That blunders a horsey.

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 But of course, I need to move my horsey.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 He's obviously threatening bishop takes C7 checkmate.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 And apparently, knight D5 is the only solution to this.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 But you know, after knight D5, E takes D5, there are even more threats to the video, which is already really bad.

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 So I guess, let's take a big risk.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Knight F5.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 And that took me a whole 40 seconds.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Backseat me all you want, I believe this is a worthy risk.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 If my plan works, the video is going to be much longer.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 If it doesn't, well, let's say it ends sooner than it should have.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 Ha ha! My experience from playing at 100 ratings paid off.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 A takes B5.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Queen takes.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 Now it's time for me to strike back.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Or maybe, even claim a victory on time.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 Queen E4.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 I mean I don't think I can win any pieces over here.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 But at least I think I can make him scared a little bit and then burn down his time.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 What the f-

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:15,000
