00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 I'm better than my viewers. The canon. I have no idea how this can look like a canon when it is

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,640
 obviously just an arrow. But anyway, welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers,

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,760
 the series that I made so that I can brag about how good I actually am while also losing to the

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,640
 100 rated guys in the challenges, and the opponent this time is a guy called lol3270.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,320
 I'll take this bishop first, I mean taking on a 2000 rated guy in a -15 position doesn't sound

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,080
 like a very good idea, but who knows, maybe he'll disconnect and I can just make up a story that he

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:46,160
 has resigned from the game. Bishop takes, queen takes is obviously not an option. Queen d4.

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:55,280
 Bishop e4 bishop e4 c6. Knight d3. I mean c5 bishop b7 queen b7 bishop e7 queen b7 queen e4

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,560
 queen e4 knight e4 will be very dangerous because we'll be going into an endgame with me being down

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:06,160
 8 points in materials, but maybe he'll get scared thinking that he'll have to play against 5 horses

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:18,240
 with his 3 same color bishops. Ha! Coward. Knight f5. Bishop e5. Knight d6. Alright,

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,600
 one knight there, if we can put 3 knights in these 3 squares, maybe we'll have a chance at

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:36,320
 an early checkmate at his king. Bishop takes d3. Knight takes d3. b5. Wow! Knight c5. Dude,

14
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:47,120
 that was very convenient. King b8. Ah ha! You see? He is getting scared. Knight f5. Alright,

15
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,800
 now all of the horses are active, all we need right now is my opponent blunders 10 moves in a

16
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:02,160
 row and allow a forced checkmate. b4. That doesn't look like a blunder. And I have no idea what to do

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:11,440
 right now. Knight d7 bishop d7 knight b7 queen b7 knight b7 queen d4 knight d4 king b7. This doesn't

18
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,720
 look good at all. And then I did the thing that everyone does when they know they are about to

19
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,560
 lose. How about a draw? Smiley face. And he declined. So we shuffled our pieces for the

20
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,240
 next 10 moves and I couldn't make any progress. I resigned. And since I started in a worse position,

21
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:45,440
 I'm better than my viewers, but this guy, and only this guy, is equal to me.

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,760
