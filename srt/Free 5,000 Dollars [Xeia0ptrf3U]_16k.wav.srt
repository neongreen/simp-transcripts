00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 100 rated chess, but I'll pay you $5 for every piece or pawn of either side that ends the game

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,320
 on a dark square. -5 for each that ends on a light square. That sounds pretty racist. Free money for

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:23,040
 me. We get a 177 from the US, E4 putting a pawn on a light square sounds absolutely stupid. D4.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:28,880
 I mean D5 will be pretty problematic because it puts his pawn on a light square, but who knows,

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,880
 maybe he'll play D6 instead and help me get another 10 bucks instead.

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:45,840
 Well, thank you. Bishop F4. London system baby. C5. Very aggressive. Eliminating materials on

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:54,560
 dark squares doesn't sound like a very good idea. E3. But then he takes me. Oh well, I guess I have

8
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,840
 no other choices. I mean it's fine if now he puts another piece on the dark square. Amazing. Bishop

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,840
 C4. Since I need a lot of things on dark squares, my light square bishop is definitely the most

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,120
 valuable piece in this game, because if I have a strong light square bishop, my opponent won't

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:21,680
 dare to put his materials on the light squares. F#@k. Knight F3. Don't worry, I'll maneuver this

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:29,280
 horsey back to a dark square later. B5. I don't want to take that pawn because it may still advance

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,840
 to B4. Bishop D5. This will force him to move his rook to B8. Or not. I'll give a check.

14
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:49,440
 You know what? Somehow I actually saw that was coming. H4. Queen E8. So instead of moving his

15
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,480
 rook, he gives me a fork instead. I'll pull it back. Because I feel like if I kept my bishop there,

16
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:07,440
 he'd play bishop D7 next forcing a trade. Bishop E7. Ha, that blunders a bishop. Knight E6. I'll

17
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:16,800
 pull this back. A6. Not gonna lie, these pawns are very annoying. D5. Moving a pawn from a dark

18
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,920
 square to a light square doesn't sound like a very good idea, but this will help me attack his

19
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,360
 queen which will move his queen to a dark square and it also attacks his knight which also forces

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:39,440
 his knight to move to a dark square. Or not. C3. Knight F5. Bishop C6. Dude. Now everything is

21
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:47,440
 hanging. And he said that it is okay to hang one more thing. I'll take it. I mean as long as my

22
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:55,680
 light bishop is still alive, he will definitely see its threats at some point. Nevermind. Oh well,

23
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,920
 I cannot let that queen live. Rook G8. That move has no f***ing usage other than reducing $10 from

24
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:12,800
 my payment. Knight D2. Knight C7. A3. Knight D5. Queen F3. A5. Queen D5. E6. Queen B5. A4. C7.

25
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:21,200
 Resignation. 13 dark squares, 9 light squares, 20 bucks. That is a very small payment,

26
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,400
 so even though I won this game, mission is failed.
