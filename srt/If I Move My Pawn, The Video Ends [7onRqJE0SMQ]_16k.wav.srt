1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 If you move your pawn or rook, the video ends.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Ah ha! I can see that this guy is just trying to say, "I want to see you arguing with money."

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And of course, I can never do that.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 And even though the challenge only requires pawns, I will explain why I added rooks later in the video.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 Let's find an opponent.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 We get a 3-12 from Brazil.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
 Well, I don't really have many moves to begin with anyway.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Knight f3.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Today, the plan is simple.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 All I have to do, is just to move my horses, until they die.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Or I can pray to God so that he will make my opponent take one of my pawns, and then I can have a gap to develop my other pieces.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And to be honest, both plans don't really sound great to me.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 d5.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Knight c3.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Knight c6.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Alright, now what the f*** do I do?

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Fine. Knight back to b1.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 e5.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 Very aggressive.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 But anyway.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Knight c3 again.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Bishop g4.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 Knight back to g1.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 I can't afford to lose my horses, because then I'll have to move my pawns.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 d4.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 Very aggressive.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 Now things are getting real bad for my video.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 I mean if I go knight e4, f5, knight g3, and even though my knight is safe on g3, there is actually no safe square for it to move to, which means I only have one piece to move the entire game.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Knight b4 is even worse, because after a6, knight a3 dies immediately to the bishop.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 So I guess, knight back to b1.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
 f6.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 Okay. Now what do I do?

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 Knight a3, bishop takes a3.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 Knight c3, d takes c3.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Knight f3, bishop takes f3.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 Knight h3, bishop takes h3.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Move my pawn? The comment section laugh at me.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Alright. I guess I'll have to go with the safest move.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Knight a3. There is a chance that this bishop is too far away for him to see.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Oh my god that worked.

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Knight back to b1.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Queen d7. I mean who cares what he does anyway.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 Knight back to a3.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 If he didn't see it last time, he wouldn't see it this time.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Yes! Let's go back baby!

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 King b8. This guy is obviously a grandmaster.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 Knight a3 again. Third time's a charm.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Well, I guess it's his charm then.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 Now as you can see, if I didn't add rooks into the challenge, I can just go rook b1, rook a1, rook b1, rook a1, and the video is going to be too long and boring.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 Anyway. Back to the video.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Now which way do I go?

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I think that, since he takes to the edge of the board, I'll go this way.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 Why is he thinking for so long?

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 Or maybe just please take my b-pawn, and then we can continue the game.

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I think he went afk. This will be our easiest victory ever.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Well, I guess I should just go back.

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 Okay then.

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:15,000
