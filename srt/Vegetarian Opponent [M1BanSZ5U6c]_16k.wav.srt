00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
 100 rated chess, but enemy king is hungry, your opponent's king must consume 3 pieces before you

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,120
 can checkmate. I don't know why I have to care about whether my opponent is dying from hunger

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:23,200
 or not, but let's go anyway. We get a 1 21 from the Philippines. E4. E5. I mean I just have to

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,480
 play normally, while also being a little bit careful when deciding to trade pieces to avoid

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:40,720
 not having enough materials for a checkmate. Bc4. Bc5. Qf3. Nf6. And I mean if he can just

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,160
 take my knight right now and lose his queen and resign the game, that will be very convenient.

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:58,160
 Too convenient to be true. d6. Ng5. Castle. No blunder from my opponent in the first

8
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:07,760
 5 moves, so it should be coming. Right. Now. I should be a prophet. That blunders a woman.

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:16,080
 F4. Even though he's lost his queen, he still decided to push a pawn to attack my king side,

10
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,880
 which is to say, very aggressive. But that blunders a pawn.

11
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,360
 D4. Ah ha. That blunders a rook, but if I take that rook, I'll be losing my bishop,

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,960
 and since the plan is to let his king take 3 pieces, I actually don't want to make unnecessary

13
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,760
 trades. So I'll take this pawn instead. I mean who knows, maybe he'll continue to blunder his rook.

14
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:50,000
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. Bxh1.

15
00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:00,080
 Kf1. Alright, now the challenge begins. Bg2 check. We still have all of our pieces,

16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:11,920
 so let's sacrifice 3 of them to complete the ritual. 1 down, 2 to go. Ng4. H4. Nh2.

17
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:21,760
 This is actually much easier than I expected. Nevermind. Nc6. Well it's fine, now he'll take

18
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:29,920
 it for sure. I have a very bad feeling about this. G takes, bishop takes, rook takes, knight takes,

19
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:42,160
 king takes. And my knight is still alive. Again, still alive. You know what? Nf1. Maybe g2 was in

20
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,040
 his blind spot, so I decided to change square so that he can see my knight a bit easier. Nevermind.

21
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:58,560
 Qxbx. Rx is not in my plan, change of square. Still in his blind spot.

22
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,080
 Fxb. As long as he refuses to take my knight, everything I do is totally meaningless.

23
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,840
 e5. That blunders a very easy to see checkmate in 7, but who cares anyway.

24
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:23,760
 Ha! Finally. Check check. My knight is unnecessarily defending my bishop.

25
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,200
 Nb8. Please take it.

26
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,960
 This guy. Is so dead.

27
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,760
 I mean that checkmate was a bit clumsy, but I managed.

28
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:56,160
