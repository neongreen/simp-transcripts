00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 100 rated chess, but it's father's day, your pieces. And pawns can only capture enemy pieces,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,880
 and pawns, 3 squares near your king, like a child trying to impress his father. Alright,

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:24,240
 it's father king today. E4. E5, just normal opening move so far. Nevermind. Knight c6.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,960
 F3. Alright, since I can only capture the things that are close to father king,

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,880
 which as you can see, is not very far away, I think it's time to make the most decisive move

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:47,440
 in this entire game. King e7. Hashtag, father's fun, matters. Bishop c4. G6. I mean pushing father

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,240
 forward can also provoke him to keep his queen closer, which means that there will be more

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:58,640
 chances for me to win the woman. Queen g5 check, of course pulling father back is obviously not

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:09,760
 an option, so I guess, f6. Queen g4, that blunders a bishop. D5. E takes d5, that blunders a woman,

10
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:18,320
 and let's see, 1, 2, 3, bishop takes g4, and then the bishop asked, are you proud of me papa?

11
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:28,880
 Ultra amazing elegant, Carlos. D takes c6. I'll pull Carlos back. D4, that blunders a pawn,

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,720
 and let's see, 1, 2, 3, I'll take the queen, well technically I don't have to count the squares if

13
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,840
 I take the queen because the queen is obviously not one of the king's children, but let's just

14
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,680
 say that the wife also wants to impress her husband. C3. That blunders this bishop, and 1,

15
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,760
 2, dead. This challenge is going way smoother than what I imagined, but the hard part is actually

16
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:17,200
 when I have to push father even further ahead. Nevermind. Happy father's day.
