00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge after 5 moves. Too easy. We get a 1 31 from Thailand.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,160
 This has to be my first ever Thai opponent on this channel, so let's welcome him with a massacre.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:23,360
 E3. Not very aggressive. E5. I only have 5 free moves, so the best plan is obviously

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:31,600
 to develop as many pieces and open up as many lines as possible. E3. Again, not very aggressive.

5
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:41,200
 D5. Fully open up the pieces. Queen F3. Spending 1 more move just to attack the queen sounds like

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:50,480
 a very bad idea, knight F6. C4. Bishop G5. I mean if I can't attack his queen with my pawn,

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:59,280
 I can attack her with my bishop. Queen G3. 4 moves out of 5, and of course as usual for my last move

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,520
 before opening up the challenge. I have to move my queen. Sometimes this decision ends up really

9
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:13,840
 badly, but I don't want to regret not spending time with my woman. C takes D5. Alright. Here we

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,560
 go. Any pieces, or pawns, that is currently on a white square is frozen and cannot be moved for

11
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:29,360
 the rest of the game. Very funny. I'll take this pawn. It's fine, I still have these pieces and

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,640
 pawns with me, and even though this knight is currently on a light square, it was on a dark

13
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:43,120
 square at the moment the challenge begins, so this knight is not frozen. H3. No way for me to save

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:56,880
 that bishop. Bishop D6. A useless bishop dies. E4. Please don't see anything. Ha! Thank you. But the

15
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,560
 question is, do I even want to take his queen though? I mean I only have this many materials

16
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,000
 to win this entire game, so losing a bishop for a queen is probably not that good of a trade.

17
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,480
 Oh well who gives a sh*t. I'll eat that woman. I mean who knows,

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,400
 maybe he'll decide to be an unpaid actor and resign the game right now.

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:37,200
 Ha! Mission accomplished.

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,480
 (upbeat music)
