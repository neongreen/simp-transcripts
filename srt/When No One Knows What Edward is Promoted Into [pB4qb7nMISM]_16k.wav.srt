1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 100 rated chess, but Edward the E-pawn is A-V-I-P. You must escort him to the end of the board with

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,760
 an entourage of at least 2 pieces or pawns, protecting him at all times. Sounds a bit too

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:21,520
 much work, but he paid me. We get a 100 rated American. D4. Of course I will refrain from

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:31,840
 pushing Edward in the early game. D6. Knight C3. Still book moves. No more book moves. D5.

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:41,200
 E5. Ah ha, that creates a chance for a French move. But again, that move is not forced.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:49,440
 B takes E6. Knight F3. I also need to refrain from taking too many pieces as it may provoke

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,600
 him to resign from the game. Knight H6. Trading pieces is also not good for me as I need a lot

8
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:05,760
 of things to escort Edward. Bishop G5 instead. Knight back down. That blunders a woman,

9
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,480
 and even though I said I should not take too many things, I can not be a coward. It's actually fine

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,840
 though, based on how he's been playing, I'm pretty sure he's not one of those people who resign

11
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:28,160
 immediately after losing their queen. Right? No doubt. Free pawn. Need to clear these pawns so

12
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:38,960
 Edward can have an open row to advance. Bishop E6. Free pawn. King C8. I need one more piece

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:50,640
 supporting E4, and what can be better than my own woman? Knight F6. Here we go. E4. Even if D5 I can

14
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,560
 push E5 and there will still be 2 pieces supporting the pawn, and in no world do you take it now.

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,800
 No world, including this one.

16
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:17,440
 Of course. Castle. H5. Bishop C4. Bishop takes queen dates. D5 I'll take instead of pushing

17
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,880
 like before, and quite frankly this is getting pretty hard to make progress as he's not leaving

18
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:32,080
 any opens in the center. But at least he's not taking my pawn. Rook over. Rook up. Knight E5

19
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:41,920
 check. King down. Need to be careful to avoid an accident checkmate. Knight takes F7. Rook G6.

20
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:51,520
 Ah ha. Finally, I can get rid of this pawn. Bishop takes rook dates. Rook takes G2. E5 is not

21
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:59,760
 supported enough at the moment. Rook E6. I don't care about that pawn. E5 is available now, but

22
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,920
 then knight G5 will be a bit annoying, I'll trade that down first. Thank you. Queen takes of course.

23
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,960
 Alright, now the way is fully opened, all I need right now is that my opponent manages to make 5

24
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:23,200
 moves within the last 10 seconds. Good start. That blunders a king, but pawn push.

25
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,840
 Please move.

26
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,760
 8 seconds, and still blundering the king.

27
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:56,960
 Mission not accomplished.

28
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
 You
