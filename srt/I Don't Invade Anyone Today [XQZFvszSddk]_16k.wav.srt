00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
 100 rated chess, but your pawns and pieces can't cross the halfway line.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:12,880
 Very short, but very challenging. We get a 100 rated American. For those of you guys who don't

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,680
 know. This, is the halfway line, which means I cannot move anything in my army past this line.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,120
 E4. The plan is simple. Sacrifice all of the pawns, so I can use my rooks to checkmate his

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:40,480
 king from far away. E5. D4. First pawn to die. Perfect. C3. Second pawn to die. Or not.

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,640
 Taking this pawn is obviously the best move now, but since the challenge doesn't allow me to move

7
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,440
 over to his side of the board, taking the full center actually doesn't have much affection as

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:01:02,400
 it usually do. Therefore, Bc4. Let's continue giving away the pawns. Qh4. Ah ha. First of all.

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,840
 Very aggressive. Secondly, Bd5 should be the best move, but the rule doesn't allow me to do that,

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:18,480
 and a move like Bd3 makes me look like a coward. Therefore, G4. Ha. I bet you've never seen that

11
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:29,040
 move before. Ne5. Wow. This has to be the first time I've ever seen a 100-rated guy seeing a fork.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,920
 Nf3. I think Stockfish might have wanted me to take his pawn and let my G-pawn die,

13
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:44,400
 but I don't like that at all. Nxc4. Ha, that blunders a woman, and since the woman is already

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:51,760
 in our side of the board, I can take it. Alright, change of plan. The original plan was to open up

15
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:58,080
 the board and checkmate his king from 100 miles away, but now since I've taken down his queen,

16
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:09,440
 let's just try to make him resign. D3. I can feel the desperation in that move. Qxd3. Ne5.

17
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,480
 Very aggressive. Let's just go back, it's still a bit too early to bring my queen out,

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:25,040
 especially when I don't have that many squares to move to. Bc5. Castle. Maybe castle was not

19
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,360
 a good decision, but who cares anyway. D6. That attacks the G-pawn, but as I mentioned before,

20
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:44,560
 if the pawns die, there will be more space for my other pieces. Therefore, b4. Bb6. a4. Push M baby!

21
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:56,560
 Dude. I said push M, not take M. Qb3. I mean he's almost ran out of time, so I'm pretty sure that

22
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:04,480
 I will win this game, as long as I don't end my own video. Nf3 check. Very desperate for a check.

23
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:12,800
 And he didn't even take back. Ng5 is obviously the best move, but of course, I need to control

24
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:21,680
 myself. Rook e1. And there we go. Wow. I didn't even think that this challenge was doable.

25
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,440
 Mission accomplished.

26
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:40,340
