00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
 100 rated chess, but you can only capture pieces with pawns, and pawns with pieces.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,560
 Not pawns. Let's go, we get an exact 100 rated guy from Kazakhstan.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,120
 E4. E5, my pawns are the only things that can capture his pieces,

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,680
 so pushing them forward can not be a bad idea.

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,200
 D3. Not very aggressive.

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,600
 D5. I don't know if opening up the board in a game that only my pawns can capture pieces is a good

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,640
 idea, but since I'm obviously not a coward, I prefer to play in an open position.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,760
 He takes D5. Bishop C5. No need to take that pawn back immediately.

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,160
 D4. That blunders a pawn, and even though I really want to take it with my pawn,

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,520
 I can only take with bishop. Who knows, maybe he'll take my bishop with his queen and let me

11
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:04,320
 take his queen for free with my pawn. Of course that doesn't happen. Bishop B6.

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,720
 D6. Very aggressive. Queen F6. Alright, take this pawn and blunder checkmate please.

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,800
 Queen D5. Ah ha. Queen takes F2 check.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,080
 King D1 is forced. Taking this bishop is obviously the best move, but since a piece can not take

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,880
 another piece according to the rules, bishop F5 instead. I'm threatening bishop C2 checkmate in 1,

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,000
 and even though I know I'm blundering my E pawn with a check, since there are 2 more different

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:49,920
 ways to capture and both of them are literally blundering a king, I'm down to take the 66.66666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666 and so on percent of victory.

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:58,800
 There we go. That blunders bishop C2 checkmate in 1 or queen C2 bishop F2 checkmate in 2,

19
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,560
 but since a king is also a piece, checkmating a king with 2 pieces may cause some of my viewers

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,440
 to dislike the video because those people assume that a player will have to capture the enemy king

21
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,800
 after the checkmate, and since a piece taking another piece is against the rules, I guess I'll

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:22,400
 have to go with, queen C2 king E1 queen F2 king D1 queen C2 king E1 queen F2 king D1. Draw by

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:36,240
 repetition. And as far as I can assume, a draw is also a win. Mission accomplished.

24
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:43,580
