1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 100 rated chess, but circus is in town, for every point of material blundered.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,680
 You laugh for 10 seconds.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,680
 Playing a game with a longer time control will make this challenger walk in the Mondstadt.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,400
 Therefore I'll keep my normal time control.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,200
 We get a 100 rated guy from Vietnam.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,320
 And to those of you who are saying that I'm a coward for not playing bullet this game.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,440
 F*ck you.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,880
 E4.

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
 D6.

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,720
 Not very aggressive.

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,080
 D4.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,640
 The plan is very simple.

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,840
 The more I laugh, the more time it takes on my clock, so my only choice is to win this

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,280
 game real fast before he manages to blunder my entire clock.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,840
 C5.

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,520
 Bishop C4.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,080
 C takes D4.

18
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,680
 Queen F3.

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,640
 And just to be clear, I'm not blundering this pawn, it is called, a gambit, and now if he

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,880
 can just go E5 to blunder his king, that will be very convenient.

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,960
 Still pretty convenient, but not very convenient.

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,080
 That blunders a pawn, and since a pawn is worth 1 point of material.

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,760
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,600
 10 seconds passed, queen takes F7.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,240
 King D7.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,240
 That drops an entire bishop, which is 3 points of material, but I definitely don't want to

27
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,400
 sit here and laugh for entire half a minute.

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,520
 Therefore.

29
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,660
 Ha ha.

30
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,400
 Time skip.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,760
 Queen E6 check.

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:43,360
 If I had taken that bishop, I would have had to laugh for at least another 10 seconds,

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,720
 so I decided to give a check, and in case he goes back, I will also go back and I won't

34
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,160
 have to spend 30 seconds again because I've already spent it.

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,000
 He went up instead.

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,440
 Ha ha.

37
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,640
 Queen D5 check.

38
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,200
 And since he's already gone up, may as well just go this way.

39
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,200
 Very convenient.

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,200
 That blunders a king, and since there is no official value given to a king, I'm not

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,360
 laughing here, queen B5.

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,960
 Checkmate.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,560
 Mission accomplished, and to those people who are saying that king is worth 50 points

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,040
 and I should have laughed for 500 seconds which means my time should have run out and

45
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,160
 I lost by time.

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,600
 F*** you.

47
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:42,240
