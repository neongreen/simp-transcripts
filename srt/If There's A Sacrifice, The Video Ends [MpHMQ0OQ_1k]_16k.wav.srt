1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 If a piece, not porn, is sacrificed, the video ends.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,440
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,580
 This is going to be annoying.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,560
 But still, I think it's quite easy, since I just have to argue that a move is a blunder,

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,640
 and not a sacrifice.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,100
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,720
 We get a 2 8 e4 from Saudi Arabia.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,480
 E4.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,440
 Aha!

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,720
 Now if I play E5, he will get his chance to play F4, which gambits a pawn, and as far

11
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,420
 as I can see, a gambit can also be considered, as a sacrifice.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,760
 So I guess, knight C6.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,560
 Developing a knight should be the safest move for this video.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,080
 Queen F3.

15
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,680
 Play aggressive.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,320
 Knight F6.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,960
 Knight H3.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,440
 Let's play a bit more aggressive.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,360
 Knight D4.

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,760
 Queen F4.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,560
 That blunders a rook.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,340
 Knight takes C2.

23
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,280
 And I believe that that was a blunder, not a sacrifice, since I don't really see that

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,280
 he can win anything by letting his rook die like this.

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,720
 King D1.

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,840
 Knight takes A1.

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
 Bishop C4.

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,480
 E5 is coming, therefore, D6.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,840
 Knight G5.

30
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,720
 Again, very aggressive.

31
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
 E6.

32
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
 E5.

33
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,080
 I'll take it.

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
 Queen takes.

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,720
 Aha!

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:54,960
 Now I have, knight G4, queen F4, knight takes F2 check, queen takes F2, queen takes G5 winning

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,960
 a pawn, but sadly, a lot of people will argue that knight takes F2 is actually a temporary

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,080
 sacrifice, which is also a sacrifice, which means I end my own video.

39
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,120
 So I guess, bishop D6.

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
 Queen B5 check.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,660
 C6.

42
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,960
 Queen A4.

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,600
 That blunders a bishop.

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
 B5.

45
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,080
 Oh wait wait wait no no no no no.

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,160
 My right hand was faster than my brain.

47
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,800
 Now if he goes bishop takes B5, it is a sacrifice of a bishop for 2 pawns.

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,980
 Ah, thank god.

49
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,680
 And in case you're wondering, I don't use my right hand as much as you do, so don't

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,660
 say anything about it being too fast.

51
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,880
 But anyway.

52
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,660
 That blunders a queen.

53
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,600
 But if I take his queen now, he may decide to not take my knight back, but to go for

54
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:58,240
 bishop takes B5, baiting me into knight takes C1, bishop takes C6, bishop D7, bishop takes

55
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,620
 A8.

56
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,480
 Of course I won't fall for that, but sadly, the beginning move of bishop takes B5, is

57
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,480
 actually a sacrifice.

58
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,760
 Therefore, let's not take the risk.

59
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,840
 B takes C4.

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,680
 Queen takes C4.

61
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,240
 I'll castle.

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
 Queen H4.

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,240
 H6.

64
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,240
 Knight E4.

65
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,320
 G5.

66
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,520
 Queen takes H6.

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,480
 That blunders a horsey.

68
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,600
 And that definitely was not a sacrifice, because I don't see he can win anything back after

69
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
 this.

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,600
 D3.

71
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,600
 Oh, wait.

72
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,440
 That blunders a rook.

73
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,920
 But if I go for the fork, my knight will no longer defend my G pawn, so he can go bishop

74
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,520
 takes G5, which turns out that he sacrificed a knight, a rook, and a pawn, so he can deliver

75
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,440
 a big attack on my king.

76
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,840
 That's 9 points of materials my dude.

77
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,360
 No.

78
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,480
 It's fine.

79
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,360
 As long as he doesn't see bishop takes G5, it is still not a sacrifice.

80
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
 Knight takes F2 check.

81
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,800
 Because if I just leave my knight right there, it will be a sacrifice of a knight to keep

82
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,600
 my king safe.

83
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,040
 King E1.

84
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,120
 Knight takes H1.

85
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,380
 Please don't see bishop takes G5.

86
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,640
 For those people who are about to comment that I'm about to get checkmated by bishop

87
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,800
 F6 queen G7.

88
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,960
 I do have queen B6 bishop F6 queen G1 king D2 queen G2 king E1 queen F2 king D1 queen

89
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,120
 F1 king D2 bishop F4 royal fork.

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,280
 But anyway.

91
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,200
 Since I already saw bishop G5 was coming, there's no what the f*** today.

92
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:08,080
