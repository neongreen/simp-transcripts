00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 100 rated chess, but the password is egghead.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 You must move your queen to land on those files in correct order to unlock the ability to checkmate.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 I actually preferred egghead more than egghead.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 But let's go anyway.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 We get a 1 0 8 from Brazil.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And by the way, very bad selfie skills.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 E4.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 First letter is an E, I have to open up the way.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 Bishop C4.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 Queen E7 makes the first step, but if I do that, my queen will be blocking my bishop's way.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 I'll move my bishop first.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Queen H5.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Alright, now the challenge officially begins.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 Queen E7.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 It's pretty concerning that his queen is preventing my queen from going to the G file for the next letter,

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 so if he can move his queen somewhere else, that will be very convenient, but not that one.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 That blunders a woman, but bishop recaptures ends the video, not to mention that there is no F in the egghead word.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 This may be the shortest video on this channel.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 Ha! Nevermind, not only does he blunder his woman again, but he also helps my woman gets the next correct letter.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 What a nice guy.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 That gets me another G.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Rook G1 and I'll also get my H.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 That is even better.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Queen takes H1.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 My god this guy is the biggest unpaid actor I've ever met.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 King E2.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 That allows another check, which comes with another letter.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 And I've just realized that it may be impossible for me to get an A this game.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 King D1.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 It's alright. I have a plan.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 He takes D4.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 The plan is very simple.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 He makes a random move, I push E3, he wouldn't want to take with pawn because he'll get 2 isolated doubled pawns,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 so bishop takes, then I can go queen A5, and then my queen on A5 will be pinning his C pawn,

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 which disallows him from pushing C3, and then I can safely go queen D4 finishing the challenge.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Oopsie! My internet is broken, I got disconnected, the video ends here.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
 Have a great day.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:49,000
