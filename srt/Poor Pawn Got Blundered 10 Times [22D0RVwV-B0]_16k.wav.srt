00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,160
 100 rated chess, but your pieces need glasses, they can only capture if the target is right

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,000
 next to them. Wow, I believe this is the first time ever that we have a situation where it

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,720
 doesn't matter whether do I say or pawn, not pawn, or not say anything at all. But anyway,

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:27,360
 we get an exact 100 rated guy from Germany. D4. E5, of course I'll use the Brexit gambit against

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:35,280
 an European. Knight F3. E4, I mean he can actually play knight H4 and I cannot take him because of

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,600
 the rules, but who plays like that anyway. Right? Bishop G5, that blunders a piece, F6.

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,320
 A desperado, now knight takes should be the best move, but according to the rules, my knights

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,760
 actually cannot take anything, therefore, G takes is kinda forced, poor horses, they are absolutely

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:09,040
 useless in this game. Knight H4. D5. Knight C3, that blunders a horsey. F5. Oh, wait. I totally

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,240
 forgot that if he makes a desperado right now, I won't be able to take him due to the rules,

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,840
 and in fact if he doesn't even do anything, I still won't be able to take him, also due to the

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:28,080
 rules. And by the way, I also cannot take that knight, also due to the rules. But anyway, I

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,440
 really want to go queen G5 to take this knight on my next turn, but that will blunder knight takes

14
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,320
 E7 check forking my rook. So I guess, I'll kick this guy away first. In no world do you go knight

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:49,440
 F6 check and force me to move my king. Knight takes F5. Finally, C takes D5, it's kinda weird

16
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:56,720
 that this knight is the one that got blundered, but the other knight had to die instead. B4. Aha,

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,880
 that blunders a queen to bishop takes B4 check queen D2 bishop takes D2, but sadly, the rules

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,720
 are ruining the fun again. Queen G5. E3. I'll take this knight, my queen is obviously much

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,280
 stronger than the other pieces in this game, so I'll use her to her maximum value. Bishop B5

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:25,200
 check. Very aggressive. Bishop blocks, bishop takes king takes. Or not. Bishop C6 bishop takes

21
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,200
 pawn takes C D5 C D5 G4 queen D7 F4 aha. Now the French move is possible, but I definitely don't

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,720
 think that helping him develop his queen straight towards my king is a good idea, so I guess,

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:47,840
 knight C6. Again, all poisson, is not forced. Rook C1. Man, I wonder how many times this guy

24
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,640
 has been blundered so far. Rook B8. Man these knights are so useless, if he can just take my

25
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,120
 knight with his rook, that will be the most convenient thing ever. Well I think we can all

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,480
 agree that sometimes convenient things like this do happen. Queen takes C6. FI bishop H6 rook F1

27
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:26,720
 queen C4 king D2 testosterone queen B4 check king C1 queen B2. Checkmate. Mission, accomplished.

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,840
