00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
 So as you guys have known, the great queen Elizabeth II of Britain has just passed away a

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,560
 few days ago, and to honor her unmeasurable accomplishments during her reign, I'll take

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,960
 on this challenge, of 100 rated chess, but your queen is queen is queen Elizabeth II,

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,560
 she must not die or be attacked. Let's go. Pushing center pawns is just exposing my queen to danger.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,960
 Therefore, knight F3. I mean these pawns will definitely be pushed, but it's just not right now.

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:39,120
 E5. That blunders a pawn. Ha, it's only been one move into the game, but we can already say.

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:48,000
 Very convenient. Knight F6. D4. No worries, my queen won't be hurt just because David

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,160
 stops guarding her. Bishop D6. Bishop G5. The plan is bishop takes E5 D takes E5 and this

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,800
 knight is dead because it spinned to my opponent's queen, but of course such a convenient thing

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,560
 cannot happen that easily. Well, I mean I'm not gonna complain about it. D takes E5.

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,880
 Queen E7. I'll take this horsey. I mean queen D6 is ending this video, but he should be able to see

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,040
 that he can just easily take my pawn back, or even go for queen B4 knight D2 queen takes E2

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
 instead of randomly moving his queen to block his center pawn. Right?

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:38,240
 Yeah, always have faith in the 100 rated opponents. Bishop H4, and I've just blundered my bishop.

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,720
 Ha, I mean it doesn't matter if he can't see it anyway.

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,000
 He's obviously planning to go rook G4 to attack my bishop. Therefore, E3. It's time to activate

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:03,040
 the queen. Knight C6. Knight C3. Rook G4. Ah ha. Finally. But now the question is, do I take his

18
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,200
 rook? Because if I take it, big chance he'll push this pawn to attack my queen, which ends the video.

19
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,200
 Well, I mean I can be a coward sometimes, but queen Elizabeth II was definitely not a coward.

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,800
 Therefore, I have to take this rook. I mean he should be able to see that attacking the queen

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,200
 now is just blundering a pawn to queen G8 check queen F8 queen takes H7, so pushing H6 first

22
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:39,520
 should be considered a good preemptive move. Right? Yeah I guess we saw that was coming.

23
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:54,320
