1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
 100 rated chess, but your queen is an Asian mom, every time she sees a piece. Or pawn,

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,760
 that piece must achieve an achievement, and she must not see anyone dies. As an Asian

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,140
 myself, I can ensure you that all the Asian moms will always see you as a failure regardless

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:24,520
 of how many achievements you have, especially when you get an A- in math. But anyway, we

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,120
 get a 166 that is not from the Asia region.

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,700
 Knight F3. Since my mom can always spot me doing bad things regardless of how far I am

7
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,360
 away from her, we definitely have to assume that the queen can see through all of her

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
 pieces.

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,800
 B5. At the moment, I can only move the things that the queen doesn't see.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,940
 D4. G6. I mean G5 will be putting the G pawn into mommy's vision, so G6 is actually the

11
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,720
 furthest I can go.

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,680
 Knight C3. Alright, since mommy definitely sees this bishop right here, he needs to make

13
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:10,380
 an achievement in case he wants to move. Therefore, bishop H6. Achievement, attacking a piece.

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,240
 And for the difficulty purpose, we'll assume that attacking a pawn can not be considered

15
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,780
 as an achievement, just like every time I get an A+ in math.

16
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:28,120
 Bishop takes H6. My bishop dies, but since mom didn't see that happen, the video continues.

17
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,100
 Knight takes H6. Achievement, capturing a piece.

18
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:39,020
 Knight takes B5. I want to castle, but since that move doesn't have any achievements, even

19
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,840
 the king himself doesn't want to mess with his wife.

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,940
 Bishop A6. Achievement, attacking a piece, and in no world do you take this pawn just

21
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,820
 to end my video.

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,060
 Knight back to C3. Alright, now let's go to phase 2 of my amazing plan.

23
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,140
 Queen C8. That move didn't have any achievements, but we all know very clear, that moms are

24
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,740
 never disappointed in themselves.

25
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:14,020
 E4. Bishop takes A6 will make mom sees her bishop dies, which is a lot of emotional damage.

26
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:20,300
 Therefore, I'll take his bishop first. Again, my bishop will also die, but as long as the

27
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,100
 queen doesn't see it, everything is good.

28
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:30,560
 King takes F1. Queen A6 check. Ha, the plan is to move the queen away from seeing the

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,660
 first 2 ranks, so now I can move all these pieces and pawns freely without having to

30
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,440
 worry about the challenge.

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:46,160
 King E1. Castle. Of course, as soon as mom doesn't see, dad goes back to sleep.

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:54,160
 Queen D3. Letting mom dies is a coward move to avoid the challenge, therefore, queen B6.

33
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,520
 Knight A4. Queen A5 check.

34
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:04,760
 B4. Queen takes A4. You know what, on second thought, maybe I'll just use mommy and not

35
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,920
 worry about the challenge instead of using all the other pieces.

36
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,360
 Knight E5. Mom sees David. D6. Achievement, attacking a piece.

37
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:26,920
 Knight D7. Very aggressive. Knight takes D7. E5 D E5 D E5 Knight E5. Achievement, capturing

38
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,960
 a pawn.

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:35,640
 King E4. Rook F D8. Since mommy doesn't see this center knight, I guess it's fine to just

40
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,900
 sacrifice him and try to get a quick checkmate.

41
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,360
 Rook D1. I'll take this pawn. Rook takes Rook takes is totally fine with achievement capturing

42
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,160
 a rook.

43
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,340
 G3. Ah ha, that is very nasty, he is opening up the way for his queen to defend his rook,

44
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:02,120
 so that after rook D1 king D1 queen A1 king E2 queen H1 is blundering a mother.

45
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,760
 A sudden resignation. Mommy's still not proud, but anyway. Mission, accomplished.

46
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:23,480
