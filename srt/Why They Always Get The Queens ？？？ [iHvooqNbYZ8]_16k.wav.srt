00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 I'm better than my viewers. Of course I am, ladies and gentlemen and everyone else,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,880
 welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers, and the challenger this time is a guy

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:20,720
 called, lol3270, with a rating of whopping 1980 points. This is not going to be good. G5. Ha,

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,520
 what kind of 2000 rated player that blunders a queen fork on the very first move.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,960
 Bishop takes H3. I'll take that bishop first, there's no reason to pick a woman when I'm

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,880
 still having many choices. Queen takes D4. Now I'll take this queen. Queen takes,

7
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:47,600
 trading queens when I'm down in materials is not a very good idea, bishop D2. I'm also baiting him

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,920
 to take my knight which blunders bishop C3 royal fork, but since he is 2000 rated, I don't think

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:03,360
 there's much hope in achieving that. Queen E4 check. Rook E3. Queen F5. I'll give a check.

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,160
 Since all of his minor pieces are on the other side of the board, if I really start to attack

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,120
 his king, there is a big chance that I can at least win some queens while he is trying to defend.

12
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:23,440
 King G8. Bishop D3. Queen E6. Ah ha. Very aggressive. He wants me to take his queen,

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,040
 and then he can recapture with a check, which makes him the attacking side. So I guess,

14
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,920
 queen E2. I just want to ask him, do you want to hold on to this strat?

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:44,320
 And he does. C5, making room for bishop C4. Knight takes B4. Bishop C4 triple skewer.

16
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:54,640
 Knight D5. Bishop D5 queen D5 rook E8 check. King H7. Ah ha, that blunders a very easy to

17
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,280
 see checkmate in 25. Rook H8 check. I can't believe he still hasn't resigned, because even

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,040
 the worst chess player on this entire planet can still see this very simple checkmate in 25,

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,640
 there's no way a 2000 rated player cannot see it. King G6 is forced. Queen G4 check.

20
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:23,760
 Queen blocks. Ah ha, that blunders a different kind of checkmate. H5, checkmate with a pawn.

21
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:37,360
 That escalated really quickly. But anyway. I'm better than my viewers.

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,280
