00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 100 rated chess, but you're a terrorist, sacrifice a piece at opponent's king every 4 moves.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,720
 Disclaimer. I'm not a terrorist. We get a 1 0 7 American.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,600
 E4. E5. Still theory.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:26,800
 Knight's E3. Vienna game, and I prefer, the Andersen defense. I actually don't know anything

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:35,680
 about this opening, but the guy's name sounds cool. Knight A4. Ah ha. I'll have to sacrifice

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,840
 a piece at his king on move 4, and at the moment only my bishop can do that. So even if I retreat

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,440
 it, his knight can still take and the video will have to end, not to mention that he can also play

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:55,200
 D4 blocking my bishop's view, therefore, bishop D4 is kinda forced. This is also really good as

9
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:04,960
 I can provoke C3 blocking his knight's way of going back. Exactly as planned. Here we go. Bishop

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:14,640
 takes F2 is forced. King takes F2. I have 3 free moves before something else has to die. Knight F6.

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:23,840
 H3. I don't know what that move is for. Knight takes E4 check.

12
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:32,480
 King E1. Ah ha. Now queen H4 is best, but then I'll have to make a sacrifice on move 8,

13
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:39,440
 so if he respawned queen H4 with G3, my queen will be put in danger, and even queen takes G3

14
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:45,440
 is not possible as that is not a sacrifice. So even though it is really difficult, I think we'll

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,440
 have to skip this amazing chance.

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,880
 Well, mission accomplished.

17
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:09,600
