 100 rated chess, but you have to move your king if you can. I normally don't take on easy challenges.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:15,600
 But you know, we need to relax sometimes. Victim is a 151 guy from the US. I'm so sorry you have

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:23,440
 to accompany me in this easy challenge. E4. The plan is simple. Give the king no square to move,

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,360
 because as a grandmaster once said, if the king doesn't have anywhere to go, he can't go anywhere.

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,760
 Therefore, B6. All of these pieces and pawns will not move for this entire game.

6
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:48,720
 Bc4. Bb7. Nothing wrong so far. Qh5. Very aggressive. G6 is kinda forced. I mean if he

7
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:55,360
 takes my F pawn now, Kx is forced, and then I may have to move my king for the entire game.

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:05,600
 But who plays like that anyway? Right? Of course, I really want to play F6 to attack his queen,

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,280
 because even though the F7 square will be empty, his light square bishop is still controlling that

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,920
 square, which means I still don't have to move my king, but on second thought,

11
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:25,040
 that move is obviously a bit too risky. So I guess, Nf6. Qg3. That blunders a pawn.

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:35,680
 Qf3. Oh, wait. This guy tricked me. He tricked me to take his pawn, then he can go Qf3 threatening

13
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,360
 to take on F7, and even though there is E6 best move right now, I cannot play that because it

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,240
 gives my king a free square to move, which means it's Nd6 forced, and then there is Bxf7 check

15
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,360
 Nxf7 Qxb7, and even though materials are equal, my knight won't be able to move anymore because

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:05,840
 it has to stops the king from moving. It's fine, at least he won't take my pawn with his queen.

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:14,720
 Nevermind. Wow. Now NxBxKx and then I'll have to move my king for the entire game.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,760
 Ha! Nevermind. Mission accomplished.

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:36,080
