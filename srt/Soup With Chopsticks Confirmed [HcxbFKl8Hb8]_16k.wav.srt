 100 rated chess, but you're eating soup with a fork, you can only capture pieces

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,720
 or pawns if they are being forked. I can't seem to see what the joke is as I have always eaten

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,120
 soup with my fork, but I guess this guy is one of those weird people who eat soup with his chopsticks.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:27,920
 We get a 1 1 6 from the United Kingdom. E4. A fork can happen much easier in an open position.

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,280
 D5. And of course he doesn't take it just to ruin my plan. Knight C6. I actually cannot take that

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,520
 pawn because my knight is not forking anything right now, but he doesn't know about that. Or

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,480
 maybe he does. That blunders a woman, but just like the pawn, my bishop is not forking anything

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,720
 right now. So I guess. D4. The plan is very simple. He takes my pawn, my knight has a fork,

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:08,320
 I win his queen, he resigns, mission accomplished. Of course it doesn't happen. He's threatening he

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,840
 takes F7, which is actually a checkmate because my king cannot take his pawn as he won't be having

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,520
 any forks at that time. Therefore, knight H6 is kinda forced. Now if he takes my pawn, my knight

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:30,560
 will have a fork, so I can at least take his pawn back. Queen E4. F5. I bet this entire channel that

13
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:38,160
 he's just gonna leave his queen right there. There we go. Once again I cannot take that woman because

14
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:46,880
 my pawn is not forking. G6 instead. Queen D3 bishop G7 bishop E5. This capture wins my knight

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,840
 as my pawn cannot take back due to the rules, queen D5. My queen will have a fork, so she can

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:02,320
 take back the piece. Knight F3. Castle. I'll keep this pawn alive to block his own way of attacking

17
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,760
 my king. Knight takes D4. That blunders a horsey, but both my bishop and knight cannot capture due

18
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:18,720
 to the rules, so I'll take this pawn instead. Queen E3. Three-way fork for my queen, therefore,

19
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,960
 free rook. It seems like I can win this game with just the woman alone as she can get a fork much

20
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:34,000
 easier than the other pieces. King up. This check looks amazing, but the rules. Queen F3.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,400
 That blunders a royal fork, but again, the rules. King D3. Ah ha, that blunders another royal fork,

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,160
 but this time, I don't have to capture. King C3. And I still cannot take this queen as my knight

23
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:00,720
 is once again not having any forks. C6. You know what, no need for woman anymore, I'll go after

24
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:11,440
 the dude. H3. Knight back. Bishop back. Knight D5 check. And in no world do you take this knight.

25
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:20,960
 Good. I don't see any checkmates yet. Pawn goes two squares. This guy is actually pretty nice as

26
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,760
 he only makes blunders as a beginner and hasn't made any crazy moves yet. Nevermind. That blunders

27
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:37,920
 a horsey, but both ways of capturing is against the rules. A4 check. King A3. B5. I'm threatening

28
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,480
 B4 checkmate in one with a pawn, and this pawn is definitely fully protected. Do not touch it please.

29
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:53,120
 F***. King H8 is forced. Knight takes D5 will make it much harder for me to checkmate him,

30
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,720
 but the biggest problem is queen takes F8, which is a queen blunder, but in this game,

31
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:08,960
 it is a checkmate. Ha, among all the good options, he decided to capture a piece that hasn't even

32
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:19,520
 moved yet from the beginning. B4 checkmate with a pawn. Mission accomplished.

33
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:32,020
