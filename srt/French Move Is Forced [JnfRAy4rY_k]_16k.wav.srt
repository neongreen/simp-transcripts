 100 rated chess, but you have to do en passant every 10 moves. That sounds pretty impossible.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,720
 But let's go anyway. We get a 1 51 from Pakistan. Checkmating him in the first 10 moves doesn't

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:20,560
 sound very practical, so I guess I will have to do some en passant to extend the length of the game.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,680
 Therefore, E4. Well, of course I need to push pawns if I want to do the French move.

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,080
 E5. D4. I know letting my pawn die in a pawn challenge sounds very stupid,

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:49,040
 but bear with me, I have an idea. E takes D4. Yes. E5. Ha! You see, this guy is totally playing

7
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:58,320
 in the palm of my hand. En passant. C takes. Okay. Change of plan. Now I have to checkmate

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,600
 him in the next 10 moves, because there is no way I can get the second en passant on the board.

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:15,840
 Therefore, queen. Takes D4. Queen A5 check. Bishop D2. Queen back to D8. Very funny.

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:25,600
 Bishop C4. I'm calculating, knight C6, queen D5, knight F6, queen takes F7, checkmate.

11
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,360
 Nevermind. Knight F3. I'm not gonna lie, it's already 4 moves out of 10,

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:41,200
 but the checkmating plan is still nowhere near its target. Knight C6. Bishop B5.

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:49,440
 Rook C8. You know what? Change of plan. The plan will go from checkmating him,

14
00:01:49,440 --> 00:02:00,000
 to forcing him to resign. Therefore, queen takes A7. Rook C7. That blunders a rook. Bishop A5.

15
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:13,440
 King E7. Very aggressive. Bishop takes C6. 1 move left. B takes. Okay. It's 8 moves already,

16
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,680
 and since there will definitely no en passant possible to happen, this will be my last move.

17
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:30,400
 Bishop takes C7. Okay. Please resign. No. I know I have to end the video right now,

18
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,160
 but please just bear with me. Just 1 more move, and I promise that he will resign.

19
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:48,480
 That blunders a queen. Yeah. This is obviously impossible.

00:02:48,480 --> 00:03:00,800
