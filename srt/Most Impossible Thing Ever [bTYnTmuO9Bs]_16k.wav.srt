00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge after 6 moves. I don't know why he picked the

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,200
 number 6 instead of 5 or 7, but I'll respect his personal hobby. E4. I have no idea what the

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,480
 challenge is, so as usual, we'll just play the game normally until move 6 and then see what

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:28,640
 will happen. E5. D4. Knight F6. D5 knight E4 queen E2 is definitely the best continuation,

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,520
 but since I only have 6 moves to play the game freely, I don't want to spend the majority of

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:43,040
 them on pawns and queen, so I guess, bishop G5. H6. Bishop H4. On second thought, maybe I should

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,240
 have taken his knight instead of wasting a move on retreating my bishop. G5. Very aggressive.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,560
 I'll take this pawn. Knight takes E4. Ah ha, now I believe we need to counter-attacking the knight

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,360
 has to be the best move, but doing that will create too many tactics on the board, which is

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:09,200
 probably not a very good idea when I'm about to unveil the challenge. So I guess, bishop G3.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,640
 D6. Alright, let's see what's under this black thingy.

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,440
 If X pawns were captured, including enemy ones, every X move must be king. And since there are

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:31,440
 2 pawns die before the challenge begins, therefore, X equals 2. Bishop C4. I mean it will be very

14
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,640
 problematic if he takes my bishop right now because I cannot take his knight back due to the rules,

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,280
 but since he didn't take it last time, there is no reason to do that right now especially

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,520
 after he's just created a war between the pawns here. Right? Well, at least now no one will call

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:58,720
 this guy a paid actor. King D2 is f***ing forced. Knight takes H1. You know what, this game is going

18
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:07,760
 very wrong very quickly, so why not try a chance. Knight takes F2. Ah ha, that blunders a king,

19
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,680
 but since the challenge forces me to move my king right now, king back to E1. I mean since

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,200
 he's blundered his king once, he'll definitely blunder his king twice. Right? Absolutely.

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,440
 Queen takes F7. Checkmate. Mission accomplished.

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:42,000
