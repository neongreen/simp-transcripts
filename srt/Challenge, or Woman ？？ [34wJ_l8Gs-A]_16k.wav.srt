00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge after you lose your queen.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,600
 This is absolutely meaningless as there is no way my 100 rated opponent can take my queen when I

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,680
 don't allow him to do so. But in contrast, it actually makes me even more curious what can be

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,640
 under this mysterious black section. So let's uncover it ourselves. We get a 100 rated American.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:36,000
 E4. D5. The only way I can see the challenge is to lose my queen. Queen H5. D takes E4.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,160
 On second thought, maybe sacrificing my queen right now is too early. Bishop C4 instead. To be

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,920
 clear, I'm not a coward, I'm just trying to approach this challenge in the most optimal way possible.

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:02,160
 Knight F6. That blunders a pawn. With check. King D7 is forced. I think queen E5 is best aiming for

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,960
 queen E6 checkmate in one, but I don't need a checkmate when my queen is still alive, queen F5,

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:19,680
 and he still blunders checkmate regardless. Bishop check instead. King down, bishop takes C8.

11
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,040
 I also need to avoid a resignation before I lose my queen, because even though that

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,200
 counts as a mission accomplished, I want to see what the challenge is first.

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:41,200
 Knight B D7. Bishop B7 rook B8 bishop C6. Rook B6. Very aggressive. It is now 10 moves into the

14
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,720
 game, and I don't think I want to delay sacrificing my queen any further as it only provokes more

15
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,640
 people calling me a coward. Queen takes D7. Queen takes will be very convenient.

16
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,000
 Well I guess everyone knows backward knight moves are very difficult to see,

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,520
 so this guy is obviously not a paid actor. We'll see the challenge first.

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,160
 You maidenless fool your king is enraged every move you make from now on must be very aggressive

19
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,600
 if you do not give a check every 2 moves the video will end very aggressively.

20
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:28,400
 Check. King takes. I have to give another check within 2 moves.

21
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,600
 Knight F3. The plan is very simple. He doesn't take my knight.

22
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,040
 Check.

23
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,480
 Check.

24
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,060
 (upbeat music)

25
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,460
 (upbeat music)
