2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 You're a stupid child, chasing your dreams and getting hurt

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 You're a bad liar, but you showed me a smile that couldn't be laughed at

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 You don't even say "I love you" well, you're really clumsy

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 But, but why did you say "goodbye"?

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 You're no good, no good, no good

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 I love you, I love you too much

8
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 No matter how strong the alcohol is

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Memories that don't waver, like a fool

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:48,000

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 You're a fool, really a fool

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 You only believe

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Pretending to be a strong woman, you bathe in the night wind of sadness

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 Three years have passed since I became alone

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 The town has changed

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 I left only regrets that I had forgotten

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 You're a really bad man

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 I'll take off your ring of love

19
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 I'll punish you

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 You're a fool, waiting for an excuse

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 You're no good, no good, no good

22
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
 I love you, I love you too much

23
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 No matter how strong the alcohol is
