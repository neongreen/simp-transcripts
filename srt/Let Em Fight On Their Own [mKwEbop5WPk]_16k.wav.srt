00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
 100 rated chess, but if your piece, not pawn, gets attacked, you must undefend it.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,960
 Well, I guess we also have to say, not king, because otherwise any checks will pretty much

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,480
 end the video. And by the way, I'm pretty sure that this word doesn't even exist.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:28,560
 But anyway, we get a 123 from the US. It's kinda strange that I'm not getting any opponents with

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:37,920
 premium memberships these days. D4. Let's be aggressive. E5. The famous blunderer pawn gambit.

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:47,040
 D takes E5. Knight C6. Now a move like queen D5 attacking my knight will force me to undefend it,

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,760
 but since there are 2 pawns defending the knight, I cannot remove them all at once,

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,080
 which means I'll have to end the video. But you know, no one plays such a random move like that

9
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:06,800
 anyway. Right? Of course. So if I remember correctly, the next theory move should be queen

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,960
 E7, but there's a small chance that he'll play bishop G5 after that, which attacks my queen,

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,400
 so I have to remove my queen's defenders, and since there would be 3 things defending my queen,

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,960
 I cannot remove all of them at the same time, which means I'll have to end the video.

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:35,840
 Therefore, H6. Let's just prevent bishop G5 in advance. G4. Very aggressive. Queen E7. Man,

14
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,320
 it's kinda scary that he can just end my video at literally any time he wants.

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:52,400
 G5. Too aggressive. I'll take this pawn. Rook G1. Ah ha, that blunder's knight takes F3 checkmate

16
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:59,040
 in 1. But sadly, his knight is attacking my knight, and according to the rules, I cannot move my

17
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,160
 knight, but have to remove the knight's defender instead. Therefore, queen B4 checkmate. Oh. Wait.

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:13,760
 I blundered. Now if he plays C3, I have to remove the queen's defender, which is the bishop over

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,680
 here, and since there is no way to make the bishop not defending the queen, I have to end my video.

20
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:31,120
 Ha! Nevermind. I'll go back. Alright dude. Second try, now just play C4 and blunder a smothered

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:42,080
 mate. G takes H6. I'll take with rook. F4. That attacks my knight, so I have to move its defender.

22
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,080
 Queen H4 check. Rook blocks is forced. Queen H2 should be the best move, but if he gets really

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,160
 aggressive and plays rook G2, I will have to move my queen's defender away, which means I will be

24
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,360
 blundering a full queen. Therefore, knight G4. Instead of me blundering a queen, let's try to

25
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:15,520
 smother his queen instead. Wow. I can't believe he saw that. Knight takes H2. Bishop E3. D5. Oh

26
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:23,760
 wait that blunders a paw. Nevermind. That blunders a horsey. Queen takes E4 check. Rook blocks,

27
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,200
 my rook is attacking his queen, but his queen is also attacking my rook, so if he doesn't move

28
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,880
 the queen away, I will have to remove the rook's defender on my next move, and since there are 2

29
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:45,280
 of them, once again, the video ends. Thank you. Bishop blocks. As I said, the challenge doesn't

30
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:53,840
 apply on my king. Queen B4. That blunders a queen, but I cannot take it, because the queen is also

31
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:03,680
 attacking the bishop, so I have to remove the bishop's defender. F*** this game dude.

32
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:13,600
 Ha! He went for the pawn instead. Queen takes G3 check, and since my time is really low now,

33
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:21,280
 let's speed up the video so you guys can also feel the intensity. King D2 queen E3 check king E1 and

34
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:29,360
 now there is a checkmate in 4 of queen C1 king F2 queen F1 king G3 rook G6 king H2 queen G1.

35
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,720
 But of course I couldn't see it in time pressure, so I went for knight F1 queen A8 check king E7

36
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,920
 C4, and even though his queen is attacking my bishop so I have to move my king away,

37
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:47,360
 f*** the rules because I don't have time left, queen takes C2, checkmate.

38
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,080
 And since I ended the video myself, there is no what the f*** today.

39
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:08,640
