1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,260
 chess, but your queen is always in the center.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,740
 Question mark question mark.

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,060
 Very aggressive.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,820
 This is like the easier version of my king in the center video, and since that video

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,320
 went well, I don't see any ways that this one can go wrong.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,300
 We get a 1 81 from Brazil.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,520
 Before the game begins, let's make this clear.

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,440
 The word center usually refers to the 4 squares in the center of the board.

9
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,480
 But as you can see, that area is too small for a fat queen to be in.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,280
 Therefore, let's just assume, that this, is the center for this game, which means I will

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,760
 have to keep my queen in this area.

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,760
 E4.

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,760
 E5.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,840
 Maybe d5 Scandinavian was better.

15
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,720
 But who cares anyway.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
 Queen h5.

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,240
 Ah ha.

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,680
 The very famous, wayward queen attack.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,640
 Queen f6 is forced.

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,920
 Alright, now the mission truly begins.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
 Knight f3.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,280
 Ah ha, he's obviously threatening queen takes e5 forking my queen and my king, which can

23
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,260
 very much lead to a queen trade, and as you already know, if my queen dies, she will have

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,320
 to go to the graveyard, which is not the center of the board.

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,360
 Therefore, knight c6.

26
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,440
 d4.

27
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,940
 Very aggressive.

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,440
 But that blunders a pawn.

29
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,440
 Wait.

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,220
 Wait a second.

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,640
 That blunders a rook.

32
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,800
 But it can end the video.

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,520
 Ok.

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,040
 Let's calm down for a moment here.

35
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,340
 If I take his queen, knight takes ends the video.

36
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:51,520
 If I block with my knight, he will most likely take my queen, which also ends the video.

37
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,280
 So I guess, queen e6 is kinda forced.

38
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,760
 Alright, now please just take my knight and be happy.

39
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,640
 Or not.

40
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,680
 Well, since the video is still so short, I guess I'll answer some of your comments to

41
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,960
 make it a little bit longer.

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,400
 Paid actor, paid actor, paid actor.

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
 Guys.

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
 Please.

45
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,800
 I don't even have enough money to feed my cat.

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,960
 That car parking explanation was fine, but you forgot the fact that your car can't jump

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,480
 over an obstacle in front of it.

48
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,080
 I hate to say this, but you are actually incorrect.

49
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,280
 I have seen a lot of cars jumping over people's heads, especially in some Bollywood movies.

50
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,920
 Can I get that 2 minutes of my life back please?

51
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
 Well.

52
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,420
 No.

53
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,920
 No.

54
00:02:45,600 --> 00:03:00,200
