 100 rated chess, but you are *******, you can only take enemy pieces, or pawns, from behind.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,880
 And this challenge was posted on Valentine's Day.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,280
 Very aggressive. We get a 191 from the US.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,800
 E4. E5. My pawns are actually useless because they can never do it from behind,

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,280
 but I of course need to push them forward to create space for the other pieces to move.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:38,400
 Bishop C4. Knight F6. G4. Aha! That blunders 2 pawns at the same time, but funny enough,

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:46,000
 I can not take any of them due to the rules. So I guess. H6. At least it will stop G5 from happening.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,840
 Not anymore. D5. Since my pawns are useless anyway,

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,160
 it's better to just sacrifice this one to open up the way for my bishop to go out.

10
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:05,120
 E takes D5, bishop G5 is best, but again, I cannot take that pawn from the front. Bishop C5.

11
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:13,840
 G5. Knight G4. The plan is very simple. Since he's been very aggressively pushing his pawns to

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,360
 attack my knight, I think we can expect F3 coming next attacking my knight which let me plunge my

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,280
 knight really deep into his territory. Or he can take my knight which blunders his woman and I

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,840
 cannot eat her because my bishop cannot do anything in front of a woman. C6. I don't know,

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:39,360
 just want to sack more pawns to create more room for the pieces to move. Queen H5. Bishop F5.

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:49,600
 King D1. Not very aggressive. And you know what? I think we should take a risk. Queen C8. Wait for

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:02:01,760
 it. Knight F3. Alright. Here we go. Bishop G4. His queen. Is trapped. But still, now there are

18
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:09,280
 3 things that can happen. Situation 1, he resigns after seeing his queen is trapped. Situation 2,

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,880
 he continues to play, but decides to not move his queen anywhere, which allows my bishop to

20
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,640
 thrust his knife into her from behind. Situation 3, he makes a desperado. And I'm f***ed. And before

21
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,000
 I show you what happened, I just want to say thank you to one of my viewer that donated me a massive

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,960
 amount of 1000 US dollar. I really appreciate it. Back to the game, and his decision was.

23
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:46,560
 Resignation. Mission accomplished.

24
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,000
