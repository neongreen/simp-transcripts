00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 100 rated chess, but you must commit to a file for 2 turns, only pieces and pawns that are

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,040
 currently inside that file can be moved. That sounds very challenging, but you know, I'm not

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:22,160
 a coward. We get a 140 from chili. E4, E5 is dumb, because since I'm stuck with 1 file for 2 turns,

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,000
 king E7 is actually forced next move. Therefore, E6, I mean since everyone knows E5 is bad in the

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,720
 French defense, he's not gonna play that move to force king E7. Right? Definitely. E5, knight F3,

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,720
 I want to take this pawn, but sadly, that will leave only my king on the E file, so king E7

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:54,080
 will be forced, which is obviously not good for the video. Therefore, G6, I'm sorry Edward,

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:04,320
 but you need to die. Edward is dead. Knight F6, knight C3, I really want to pianchetto my bishop

9
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,480
 right now, but if I do that, I will have to stick with the F file for 1 more turn, and I can't really

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:19,200
 find a good move on the F file. So I guess, D6. I would rather move my queen then. Knight C4,

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,880
 queen E7. D5. That blunders a pawn, but after knight takes, I cannot take back because I have

12
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,480
 to stick to the F file, and even though there is F5, I don't think I want to fight against queen

13
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:42,720
 E2 with such difficult challenge on my shoulder. So I guess, bishop G7. E5, knight F D7. Everything

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,960
 is good. Bishop D3, aha, I want to take with my horsey, but then I will have nothing on my D file

15
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,840
 to move, which means I'll have to end the video. So I guess, I'll take with pawn, now let's just

16
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:08,960
 hope that he won't play D6 and win my queen. Thank you. Knight B6. Rook B1. Oh no, I think

17
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,320
 there is a decent chance that he may blunder rook takes E5 next thinking that he is skewering my

18
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,440
 queen and king. Therefore, let's be safe, and take this knight. I mean rook E5 is still winning my

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,120
 queen because I'm being stuck with the B file for 1 more move. But who plays like that anyway?

20
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:40,000
 Right? Of course. B6. Man somehow I feel like this move was really bad. Knight E4. Aha, he's

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,840
 obviously aiming for bishop G5 attacking my queen or D6 also attacking my queen. Therefore, castle.

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,760
 My king was on the E file, so no matter what he is playing now, I will get to move my queen after

23
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:02,960
 that. Exactly as planned. Queen to B4. Okay I know that move was really risky, but to be honest,

24
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:10,640
 this game is not going anywhere if I don't start attacking him. C3. That blunders a bishop. Oh,

25
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,080
 wait. Since my queen was on the B file, now I have to stay with the B file for 1 more move,

26
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:26,800
 so if he plays B3 right now, my king will be maidenless. Thank god. That blunders a woman,

27
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:32,160
 but I obviously cannot eat her due to the rules, and it is very obvious that he wants to go knight

28
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,520
 F6 check with a discovered attack on my queen. Therefore, knight C6. You may say that B5 is a

29
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,760
 safer move, but if you really think about it, B5 still allows knight F6 check, and after bishop

30
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:51,280
 takes, I will be stuck with the G file, which means I won't be able to recapture my opponent's

31
00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:01,040
 queen. D takes C6. Ha! Noob. Bishop takes the woman. And even better, I will get to move my

32
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,960
 queen on my next move, so unless he goes crazy and gives a check that also ends the video,

33
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:14,160
 nothing can go wrong right now. Resignation. Well I guess that is also a way to end the video,

34
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,160
 but the difference is, mission accomplished.

35
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:32,660
