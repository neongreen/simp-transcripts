00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
 100 rated chess, but if your pawn can move, it has to. Very challenging. We get a1 o3 from the US.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,520
 a4, my plan is to let him push a center pawn first, and then I'll push back,

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:26,400
 which makes my pawn cannot move forward anymore. d5. Yes. d4. Ha, 1 down, 7 to go.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,640
 Bishop f5, it's gonna be a big problem if he goes knight c6 knight before attacking my c2 pawn.

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,160
 So I guess, b4, he should be able to see, that knight c6 will be attacked immediately by b5.

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:50,960
 Right? Well, pushing b5 now will allow knight b4, and since I cannot stop knight c2,

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,000
 c3, let's just hope that he doesn't take my knight with his bishop.

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:07,920
 Thank you. b5. Ha, free tempo. Or not. That blunders a horsey. But should I even take it,

9
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,000
 though, because if I take his knight, b takes c6 opens up the b file for his rook to attack my

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,160
 knight along with his bishop. Well who cares, b takes c6. I mean the mission is already very hard,

11
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:31,280
 so losing a few pieces in the process is pretty much unavoidable. b takes c6. 2 down, 6 more to go.

12
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:49,520
 g3. Ha, free tempo again. Queen f6. f3. Rook b8. Oh no here he comes. h4. Rook takes b1. Well,

13
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,440
 I was expecting bishop takes b1 winning a knight, but that is actually just a trade after rook takes

14
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,680
 bishop takes queen b3 and he'll have to give back a bishop or lose a queen, but sadly, I cannot do

15
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:11,120
 any of those things, due to the rules. Therefore, g4, at least that is kind of a tempo. Bishop g6.

16
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:22,160
 That missed a free rook. But anyway. h5. Bishop c2. Wow, somehow he really did find out the only

17
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:33,600
 safe square. g5. Ok, it's very close to the point that I can move a piece now. Queen f5. e4. That is

18
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,440
 a very risky move, but after d takes e4 f takes e4 queen takes e4 check, I can go queen e2 because

19
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,960
 I cannot move a pawn during a check, and you know, there is a chance that he will trade queens

20
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,480
 instead of taking my rook in the corner, which makes it a really worthy risk. Nevermind. That

21
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:06,080
 blunders a woman. But anyway. g6. Queen takes e4 check. Ok here we go. Queen e2. Please trade

22
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:16,000
 queens. Well that actually helps stop my h-pawn, so it's also kinda good for the video. G takes f7

23
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:25,760
 check. King takes. c4. Somehow I have a feeling that I've just blundered my king. Bishop b4 check.

24
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:39,600
 King f2 is forced. Knight g4 check. King g3. Rook b3 check. Aha! Finally. Knight f3. I bet you have

25
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:48,720
 never seen anyone who develops their first minor piece at move 20 like I do. g6. c takes d5,

26
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:57,280
 let's just move fast to flag him down. g takes h5. That blunders a queen again, but d takes e6

27
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:07,440
 check. King takes e6. That blunders the queen one more time, but sadly. d5 check. King takes again.

28
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:16,480
 a5. One more move, and we go all out. Rook d3. That move shows that he's panicking from time

29
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:27,760
 shortage. a6. And he ran out of time. Mission accomplished.

30
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:40,120
