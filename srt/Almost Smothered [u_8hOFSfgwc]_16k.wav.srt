00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
 100 rated chess, but if a piece, not pawn, dies, the king must go to the square that it died to pay

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,080
 respect. If the king gets checked 3 times, the video ends. This challenge was worded incredibly

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,680
 badly, we obviously need to add something like "before another piece dies on another square",

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,880
 or else the game would be a normal game with my king lands on every single square at the end to

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,320
 pay respect to everyone at the same time. Let's go. E4. Since the pawns are not affected by the

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,440
 rules, I'll let them all die to open up the board so that my king has more space to move. D5. I mean

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:47,680
 I'm also sacrificing a check here, but I think it's absolutely worthy. F3. Not very aggressive.

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,680
 E5. Knight C3. I'll take this pawn. Again, pawns are not included in the mission,

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,440
 so my king doesn't have to go to this square. Bishop C4. Aha, now we can be sure that he won't

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,760
 go bishop E5 just for an empty check. I'll take this pawn as well, in no world do you take this

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:18,560
 pawn just to take away one of my 3 checks. Of course. Knight C6. Castle. Okay now this is

12
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:29,200
 actually pretty dangerous. Knight F6. Knight G5. That blunders a bishop. Queen D4 check. King H1.

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,600
 But now comes the question. Do I take his bishop? If I take his bishop now, my king will have to

14
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,360
 go all the way to C4 to pay respect, and I have absolutely no doubt that the video will be ended

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:51,760
 before he can reach the place. Yeah I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna do it. Knight G4. Call me

16
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,840
 coward all you want to, but you know what people say, if you want to be brave, you need to be

17
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:08,320
 cowardly. Knight takes F7. Aha, exactly as planned. Knight F2 check. My plan is king G1 knight H3

18
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:15,040
 double check king H1 is forced queen G8 check rook takes G8 knight F2 smothered mate. And I mean even

19
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,400
 though he has rook takes F2 now to absolutely ruin my plan, he's not gonna see a smothered

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:29,760
 checkmate in 4 moves. Right? Wow. Now I have to move my king all the way over there, without being

21
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,680
 checked 3 times, and no piece is allowed to die on a different square before my king reaches the place.

22
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,720
 How the f*** is that even possible?

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,720
 Well I guess we all know that this mission is a failure. I'll just let him take my rook and end

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,360
 my video. Yeah there's no way this is doable.

25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:06,000
