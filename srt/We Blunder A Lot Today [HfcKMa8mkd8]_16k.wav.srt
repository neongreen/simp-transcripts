00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
 100 rated chess, but the number of pieces that you need to sacrifice is the number of brilliant reaction,

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,600
 so add many brilliant reactions as possible please.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,100
 There is no way I can sacrifice 11 pieces as I only have 7,

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,300
 and even if we count the pawns, it would still be way too difficult.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,000
 Therefore, I'll change it to...

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,900
 blunders that I need to make.

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,900
 And I'm not a coward.

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,500
 We get a 101 American.

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,700
 I need to make bad moves that give away materials,

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,500
 and the worst first move in my opinion is G4.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,300
 E5.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,600
 Ah ha!

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,700
 First blunder, B4.

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,000
 And for those of you who cannot see why that was a blunder,

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,300
 first of all, do you suck?

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,300
 And secondly, it blunders this pawn.

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,400
 Qh4.

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:00,400
 I don't want to blunder two pawns at once since it only counts as one blunder.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,800
 H3.

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:10,300
 I'm still blundering my B pawn, so even though H3 defends another pawn, it is still a blunder.

21
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,000
 Bishop E7.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
 Third blunder.

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,100
 3 out of 11, and I still haven't lost a single thing.

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,400
 D5.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,900
 Ah ha!

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,700
 He's blundering a pawn, but if I take that pawn, my knight will be defending my B pawn,

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:33,900
 which means I'm not blundering my pawn anymore, so I guess, knight back to B1.

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,300
 This pawn is helping me a lot, therefore no need to defend it.

29
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,900
 Bishop F5.

30
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,900
 That blunders a bishop.

31
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,900
 And even though I took his bishop, I'm still blundering my B pawn,

32
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,400
 so the situation was him blundering his piece, me blundering my pawn,

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:58,400
 two completely separate things, so it still counts, as a blunder.

34
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,400
 And don't argue with me.

35
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
 He finally took the pawn.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,400
 It's amazing how he managed to immediately see this very far horizontal queen move,

37
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,400
 but failed to see the a lot shorter advancing bishop move.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,900
 But anyway. I have to blunder something else. F6.

39
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,900
 Bishop C5.

40
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,400
 Ah ha!

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:25,400
 This is probably the biggest "Ah ha!" of this entire channel,

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 because he is obviously provoking me to take his G pawn aiming to make another queen,

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,900
 and then he can go bishop takes F2 f***ing brilliant move to sacrifice his bishop

44
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,900
 and then go queen H4 making a draw by repetitional checks to make me cry

45
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:43,400
 while moving my king non-stop and unable to promote my pawn.

46
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,400
 Therefore, bishop G2 instead.

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,900
 Even though I'm counterattacking his pawn, knight F6 takes my pawn and also defends his pawn,

48
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:57,400
 so bishop G2 is also a blunder.

49
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,900
 Queen H4. Defends the checkmate.

50
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,900
 9 blunders, 2 more to go.

51
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,900
 I think we can already celebrate this victory.

52
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,900
 I shouldn't have said that.

53
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,900
 King takes F2 is forced.

54
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,900
 A forced move cannot be a blunder, still 9 out of 11,

55
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,900
 and since he forced me to take his queen, there won't be a resignation.

56
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:30,900
 You know, the worst thing is that I get A+9 after that game,

57
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,900
 which means for every blunder I made, I actually gained 1 rating point.

58
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,900
 I'm not sure if I'm a good player or not.
