00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,400
 100 rated chess, but queens are always protected. And furthermore, I cannot take my opponent's queen,

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,440
 or lose my queen, because that will make the challenge too easy. Let's go, we get a 1 18 from

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:25,280
 the US. E4. D5. Oh no no no no no no no. Taking his pawn is obviously provoking him to end my video.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,880
 Therefore, E5. The plan is simple. Close down every single way that his queen can go out.

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:41,120
 F5. Ah ha, the French move always looks very tempting, but everyone knows, that it only

6
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:49,040
 helps him develop his horsey. So I guess, D4. After all, en passant, is not forced.

7
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,720
 Queen D6. I can easily tell, that the video is going to end, very soon. That blunders a queen,

8
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:06,800
 but of course, I cannot take it due to the rules, and queen B4 is a threat, so I guess, C3. Please,

9
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,160
 see that your queen is under attack and retreat her to the original square, because this is a bit

10
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:21,120
 too dangerous for my video. Oh no please stop doing this to me. Queen H4 ends the video,

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,000
 therefore, knight F3. Alright. It's still fine.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,200
 What the f-

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:47,680
