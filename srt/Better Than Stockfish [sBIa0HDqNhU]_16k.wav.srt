00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 I'm better than my viewers. Agincourt. In case you don't know what Agincourt is. Don't worry,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,040
 a lot of people also don't know about it. Ladies and gentlemen and gays, welcome to another episode

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,840
 of I'm better than my viewers, and the viewer this time is a guy called, Rick Astley. And no,

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,480
 not the real one. Knight b3. I don't know, that was just a random move, I want to see how he

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,440
 decides to play this game first. Bishop takes a6, okay so he wants to play on this side and at the

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,160
 edge of the board. So I guess. E5. As the grandmasters always say, if your opponent attacks

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:48,400
 you on the side, attack the center. Knight takes h5. Ah ha, I think taking this knight is not a

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,320
 good choice because it's gonna open up the file for his rook and his queen. So I'll go for. Rook

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,080
 f2. I want him to think that I want to trade rooks, but the real purpose is that I want to open up my

10
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,280
 queen's attack toward his knight, and if this plan works, I think I have a great chance at turning

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,920
 the table of this game. Perfect. That blunders a horsey. Alright, change of plan, we're not attacking

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,400
 the center anymore, but instead go for a quick checkmate at his king. Knight takes a5. H7.

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:31,200
 This rook is pinned, so he cannot take my pawn. Bishop g7. Rook g2. Alright, now if he can just

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,160
 go king f8 blundering h8=queen check bishop h8 queen h8 checkmate in 2. That will be very convenient.

15
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:47,680
 Of course it doesn't happen. I'll take this bishop. Knight b3. Guys, when your king is being

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,520
 attacked by 23 points of materials, please don't try to counterattack your opponent's king with a

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,640
 lonely horsey. Rook g8. And now if he can continue to take my rook which blunders rook f8 king f8 h

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,920
 pawn changes gender with a checkmate. That will be absolutely amazing. This guy just never blunders

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,840
 his king. Rook f8 anyway. King d7. I'll take his woman. Stockfish didn't seem to like that move

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:23,760
 very much, but as a human being, I'm just gonna say, Stockfish sucks. Knight takes d8. H pawn

21
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:33,440
 changes gender. Ha! Who's maidenless now? Rook takes f1. Very aggressive. I'll take it. Knight

22
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:44,240
 takes d2. King e1. Rook c2. E. 6. Again, Stockfish didn't like that move very much, but I think it

23
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:53,280
 actually wants my opponent to play king c6, which is very, very unnatural. Rook takes. That should

24
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:12,080
 blunder the king. Queen d5 rook d6 queen h7 king c8 queen a8. Checkmate. I'm better than my viewers.

25
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,660
