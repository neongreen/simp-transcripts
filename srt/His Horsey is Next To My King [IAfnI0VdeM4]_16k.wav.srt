00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
 100 rated chess, but your pieces, and pawns, have anger issues, a piece, or pawn, cannot

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,760
 capture unless when it is attacked, and from then on, it is only allowed to do moves with

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:21,120
 captures. Sounds absolutely impossible, but of course, I'm not a coward. We get a 1 24

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:28,040
 from Brazil. E4. It's fine, all we have to do is to win, while trying our best to avoid

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:38,600
 as many captures as possible. E5. D4. The plan is simple, E takes D4, C3, D takes E3,

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:45,240
 bishop C4, C takes B2 will be attacking my bishop so I can go bishop takes B2. A perfect

7
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:53,640
 Danish gambit. Nevermind. I'm attacking this pawn, but he's also attacking my pawn, therefore,

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,800
 D takes E5. Knight takes E5. F4. I mean even if he decides to leave his knight here, I

9
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,440
 actually cannot take it because this pawn is not being attacked by anything, but who

10
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:15,320
 plays like that anyway? Right? Of course. F5 is just blundering queen H4 queen E4 queen

11
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,200
 H1. Therefore, knight F3. In no world do you take this pawn and then laugh into my face

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:31,200
 because I cannot take your knight due to the rules. Are you serious? Knight C3. Bishop

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,120
 E7. Bishop C4. I mean he should be able to see, that knight takes G2 check is just blundering

14
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,400
 a horsey after king F2 knight H4 queen D5 knight H6 bishop takes H6 and then he'll have

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:53,880
 to castle instead of taking my bishop back. Right? Of course he sees it. G3. Well actually

16
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,640
 if he retreats his bishop right now, I still won't be able to take his knight due to the

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:07,200
 rules, but most people will just make a desperado here. Right? Knight G2 check. That traps a

18
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:15,960
 horsey. Bishop takes G3. I'm attacking his bishop, and he's also attacking my pawn, therefore,

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:25,140
 H takes G3. Knight F6. And again, I still cannot take this knight, due to the rules.

20
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,720
 This horsey is f***ing invincible. Knight G5. Let's try to checkmate him real fast before

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,160
 his other horsey can cause the same amount of destruction. Knight takes E4 check. That

22
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:46,200
 knight is also attacking my knight, therefore, that blunders a horsey. F6. I'll take this

23
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:57,480
 pawn. Queen E7. Queen H5 check. Queen F7. Ah ha! My woman is attacking his woman, and since

24
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:05,640
 his woman is also attacking my woman, there can only be one woman wins. King D8 is forced.

25
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:13,080
 Ah ha! That blunders a king to knight G5 rook E8 knight E6 rook E6 rook H8 rook E8 rook

26
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,920
 E8 checkmate in 4, but since the rules said after capturing, a piece can only make moves

27
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,400
 with captures. So I guess, knight takes F6. He should be able to see, that rook takes

28
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:36,160
 H1 is just blundering queen to E8 checkmate in 1. Right? That is very convenient. Queen

29
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,120
 takes F8. Checkmate. Mission, accomplished.
