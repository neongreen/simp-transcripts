00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
 100 rated chess, but the pieces, not pawns, can only make the longest available move.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:14,400
 Well, there are actually some problems with this idea. You see, in this position, my queen's

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,640
 longest available move is queen h5 check, but after that, the longest available move for my

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,200
 queen is queen back to d1, which means my queen can only go back and forth between d1 and h5 the

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:34,640
 entire game. Therefore, let's add something like. In that direction, and it's like in this position,

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,560
 queen d3 is also good, since it's the longest possible move in this direction, or in this

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:46,320
 position, queen b3 also works, because it's also the longest move in this direction.

8
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,600
 And with that out of the way, let's start the game. We get a 1 55 from columbia.

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,320
 E4. Let's take some center space, since it's going to be hard to develop my bishops.

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:10,720
 E5. Aha! That move opened up his dark bishop, which means bishop e7, bishop d6, bishop c5,

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,720
 and bishop b4, are all threats to my video. Therefore, b4. With this move, I'm making bishop

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,320
 b4 his longest available bishop move, and it comes with a free pawn, so he won't play the

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:32,640
 other moves that can end my video. Knight f6. I think he's afraid that I'll play c3 after he

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,360
 takes my b-pawn. Therefore, knight c3. And in no world do you end my video now.

15
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,800
 Knight c6. Knight moves are good, since they always have the same length. Knight f3. I mean

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,960
 knight takes b4 is also fine, because that will make bishop c5 his longest bishop move,

17
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,440
 which is also very natural. Or just absolutely block the bishop instead.

18
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:10,560
 But anyway, that move opened up his other bishop, and just like last time, g4, I mean bishop takes

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,400
 is so obvious now, since that also pins my knight to my queen. Or not. And that's bad,

20
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:26,400
 since bishop f5 cannot happen due to my pawn on e4. Bishop h3. Let's just hope that he'll get

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:36,000
 scared and move his knight away, so there can be a bishop trade. F5. Very aggressive. He takes f5.

22
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:46,640
 Ha! Now bishop f5 is available again, and he will definitely play it. Right? Of course. d4.

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,560
 I think he can do something with my f-pawn here, but I think it's not that bad. He takes d4. Knight

24
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:06,160
 takes d4. Knight takes d4. Queen takes d4. Bishop takes c2. Very aggressive. That blunders a horsey.

25
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:13,440
 I'll take with queen. Okay, now comes the hard part. The board is now very opened up, which means

26
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,680
 there are all tons of moves possible, which means he can pretty much end my video any time now,

27
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,720
 or he can just blunder his king in one move, but there's no way that can happen anyway.

28
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:34,240
 I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. Queen takes d7. Checkmate.

29
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,760
 Mission accomplished.

30
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:52,480
