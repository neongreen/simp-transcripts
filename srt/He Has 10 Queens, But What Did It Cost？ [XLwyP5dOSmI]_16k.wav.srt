1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
 I'm better than my viewers, you are black and white moves first.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:09,280
 Well, it's not like people gonna let me play with white anyway.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,480
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers, the series

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,280
 that I made so that people can humiliate me in a chess game, but apparently no one has

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,160
 been able to do that yet, and the challenger this time is a guy called Texan Ranger.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,400
 He took a horsey.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,240
 I take a queen.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,480
 Man, it's actually pretty sad that even though this king has 10 wives, he has to spend his

9
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,840
 life alone in a very distance corner of the board.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,520
 Queen takes queen queen takes queen queen takes queen queen takes queen.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,480
 We can call that the women fight.

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,960
 Queen takes queen.

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,960
 Bishop takes queen.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,000
 I bet he doesn't have the gut to take this bishop.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,200
 Ha!

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,520
 Coward.

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,520
 G4.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,760
 Okay so as you can see, Stockfish didn't like that move very much, but even after I've spent

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,760
 an entire night thinking about this position, I still couldn't find any problems with it,

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,120
 so if you have any explanations about this position, please feel free to leave a comment

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,280
 below to brag about your IQ.

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,520
 Queen takes F2.

23
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,040
 Ah ha, I haven't taken this pawn yet because the queen might come down to C6 and absolutely

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,640
 destroy my position, but since she has moved away from the diagonal.

25
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,760
 Bishop takes E6.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,240
 D takes E6.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,820
 D5, opening up this very strong diagonal.

28
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,420
 Queen takes G2.

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,260
 Queen takes G2.

30
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,920
 Queen takes G2.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,320
 This pawn is about to change his gender, therefore, bishop E5, preparing a skewer.

32
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,900
 Queen takes E5.

33
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,260
 That blunders a queen, bishop C7 discovered check.

34
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,680
 King H7.

35
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,760
 Rook takes E5.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,400
 Queen G6.

37
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
 Very aggressive.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:04,440
 Knight G5 queen G5 F G5 king G6 rook G8 I don't see any checkmates king G5 rook G7 king

39
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,340
 H4 ah ha.

40
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,040
 Now queen H8 is a very obvious side-ranked checkmate in 1, but you know what they say,

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,360
 if you see a mate in 1, look for better.

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
 Knight F5 king H5 queen H8.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,640
 Checkmate in 2.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,440
 I'm better than my viewers.

45
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:36,300
 [Outro]
