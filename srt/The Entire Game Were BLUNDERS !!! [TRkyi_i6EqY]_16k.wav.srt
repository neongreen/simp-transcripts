00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
 100 rated chess, but your pawns are plotting against you. You need to get rid of them before

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:12,480
 making any captures. Okay there is no way this is possible in any circumstances, but as a real man

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,760
 and not a coward, I can not withdraw myself from difficulties. E4. Well I mean in order to let my

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:29,040
 pawns die, I of course need to push them forward. E5. D4. I'm sorry David, but someone needs to die

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:37,760
 first, it's just a little bit unfortunate that it turned out to be you. Or not. B4. Alright,

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,640
 two choices, three ways to capture, there's no way he's not taking anything.

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:51,440
 C4. Okay this is actually pretty concerning because the challenge itself was already very

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,120
 hard, and if he also doesn't take my pawns at all, I may have to take things further just for

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:08,800
 the sole purpose of provocation. Aha! Thank you. Knight C3. Of course. Knight D5. I mean this

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,160
 situation is quite dangerous, but there's nothing I can do as captures are not allowed at the moment.

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:24,080
 F6. Not very aggressive. Bishop F4. I'm threatening to trap his queen, the purpose is to provoke D6,

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,200
 because since these pawns are not likely going to be pushed, I need to get his light bishop active

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,360
 so that it can take my pawns on this side of the board. And then he decides to blunder his queen

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,320
 instead. Bishop C4. I don't know, I just felt like I had to put my bishop in the middle of everything

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,880
 right here. And the box is ruined. That blunders the queen and the fork the second time in a row,

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,720
 but again, I cannot make any captures. Queen G5. Alright, I mean now he has to push D6 to attack

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:05,200
 me. Nevermind. Rook C1. My rook is not defending this pawn anymore, now go queen A5 to take it.

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,880
 Perfect. But this move also creates a problem, as he no longer can push D6 to develop his light

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:19,840
 bishop. Therefore, knight C7 check. After king D8, his king will be defending his bishop,

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:28,000
 which once again allows D6 to happen. Not gonna lie, I totally did not see that coming.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:39,680
 Bishop back. Queen B6 knight F3 F5 queen H4. Finally, some progress. Or not. Knight E5. I'm

22
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,920
 attacking this pawn, so you take this pawn to protect this pawn. Or you blunder your queen to

23
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:54,480
 distract me from attacking your pawn. Alright, how about this. King D2. Maybe he didn't see

24
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,800
 the backward knight attack, but there is no way he cannot see a melee king fight.

25
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,320
 And then he decides to defend his pawn by that amazing queen move.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,600
 You know what. F*** this challenge. There's no way I can do it. I mean most of his pieces

27
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,560
 haven't even moved yet but my position has already been destroyed, post game analysis

28
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,880
 says 11 blunders from both sides, this opponent is way too powerful for me. I'm out of here.

29
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:37,280
