 100 rated chess, but you need to make a position where you can checkmate your opponent in at least

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:13,760
 3 different ways. If they resign, you lose. Very challenging. We get a 2 24 from Brazil.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:23,600
 D4. The best opening to get an early checkmate against D4, is of course, E5. England, gambit.

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:33,840
 E3. Not very aggressive. E4 knight H3 D5 bishop E2. I'll take that horsey. Destroying his king

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:43,840
 side can never be a bad choice. G takes H3. Bishop D6. Alright, please castle. Maybe later.

6
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:53,360
 Queen H4. Bishop back. Well, not very aggressive. So in order to create 3 ways to checkmate him,

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:02,080
 I need a lot of pieces into the attack straight at his king. Therefore, knight D7. Bishop E5. C6.

8
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:10,720
 A4. Ah ha, that blunders a bishop, but if I take his bishop, my opponent may decide to resign,

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,120
 as that is literally the only piece he's been moving from the beginning of the game.

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:23,520
 So I guess, I'll take this pawn instead. Bishop D2. Queen G2. I mean I technically don't want to

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,480
 take this rook to avoid a resignation, but putting the queen here should help a lot in order to

12
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:39,280
 attack his king. Knight C3. Knight F6. Queen E2. Ah ha, he obviously wants to castle queen side,

13
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,160
 which is definitely going to be really bad for this video because my queen is still on the king

14
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:51,520
 side. Therefore, I have to take this rook. Queen F1 queen F3. Stopping his king from castling.

15
00:01:51,520 --> 00:02:00,560
 Queen back to E2. Oh no. He wants to block my queen's view and castle, so I need to go,

16
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:08,240
 queen H1 again, queen F1 queen F3. I mean in case he really goes queen E2 next, I cannot go back to

17
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,400
 H1 due to 3-fold repetition, but who knows, maybe he himself doesn't really want to draw.

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:25,280
 Ha, of course he doesn't want to draw. I'll take this pawn. Queen H1. That blunders a queen.

19
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,720
 You may say that taking his queen is a stupid idea because that is just provoking him to resign the

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,880
 game, but no, since he didn't want to draw by repetition, he is obviously aiming for a win,

21
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:43,440
 and someone aiming for a win obviously never resigns. Of course.

22
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,320
 What the f-
