00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 100 rated chess, but you have to blunder every piece. Not pawn. At least once, for the true

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,920
 100 elo experience. You know, blundering every piece sounds like a total disrespect to the 100

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:23,040
 rated players out there, but I mean who cares anyway. We get an exact 100 rated guy from Colombia.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,320
 G4. Ah ha. D5. It's very rare to see a 100 rated guy knowing about the grob opening,

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,200
 so I suspect this guy is secretly high rated, and is just trying to smurf.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,560
 Nevermind. Now I have bishop F5 blundering a bishop, but the challenge only said that I have

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,160
 to blunder every piece at least once, and did not say that I have to blunder them every time I can.

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:01:00,160
 Therefore, I'll take this pawn. Qd3. Very aggressive. Nc6. The plan is to win some

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:08,800
 materials first, and then try to give back materials as we play. Qe4. That blunders a queen,

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,400
 but do I even take it though, I mean eating another woman always sounds very tempting,

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,440
 but there's an enormous chance that he'll just straight up resign the game after his wife is

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:30,880
 taken. You know what? I think it's fine. Alright dude, now just calm down, continue playing,

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,720
 and I promise I will give you back some materials very very soon.

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:45,600
 Ah ha. There we go. Bp2. Giving back materials is kinda forced now, because I totally don't

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:56,800
 want him to resign. Bd8. Another piece here. Exd4, Qxd4. I mean that was more like a sacrifice of a

16
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:06,160
 knight for 2 pawns, but let's just ignore that for now. Bg4. Very aggressive. E5. I'm amazed

17
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:15,120
 that he knows how to stop castling, but blunder a queen very early like that? C3. Qd5. I want to

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,640
 keep my queen active so that I can easily sacrifice her later in the game. What the f*** was that?

19
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:30,080
 Wow. I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. Rxc8. I mean since he wanted me to

20
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:40,160
 take his bishop, there is no way he would resign right now. Right? Why is he thinking for so long?

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,920
 Kf1. That blunders a lot of things over here, but I definitely don't want to take more than

22
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:57,440
 necessary. E3. Fxe3. That blunders a rook, but again, I don't think taking it now is a good idea.

23
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:06,880
 Ba3. I mean I may consider taking it after he takes my bishop. Or not. Ha. The challenge said

24
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,320
 I have to blunder every piece at least once, and since I have already blundered this bishop last

25
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:20,000
 move, I don't have to blunder it anymore, which means I can go. Bb7. Now this bishop will be

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,760
 invincible, and I will not trade it with anything, since all of my other pieces will very likely be

27
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:35,120
 dead later on. a4. Alright, now for the biggest challenge of them all. I have to blunder my king,

28
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,520
 and he must not see the checkmate sequence. And to be honest, the second one sounds a little bit

29
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:48,320
 too difficult. Let's just take this rook. I mean leaving too many pieces will only allow him to

30
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:55,600
 have easier chance of spotting a checkmate. Another pawn push. Let's fast forward a little bit.

31
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:04,800
 Kd7 Nd2 Ke6 Ne4 I'll take it Nf3 I blunder my woman rook takes Kd5 h5 Kf5.

32
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:11,120
 Kc4 Nd2 check. And as you can see, my opponent doesn't have much time left.

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:21,600
 Man. I totally should have chosen a longer time control. Kd3. And it's over. But now what?

34
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,680
 The video didn't end, so there is no what the f*** today, but the challenge was also not

35
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,920
 accomplished, so there is no mission accomplished. What kind of situation is this?

36
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,520
 Oh well. I guess I'll just play the outro.

37
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:54,480
