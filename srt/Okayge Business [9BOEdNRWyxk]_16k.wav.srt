1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
 100 rated chess, but it's a wife trade, you must capture your opponent's queen with your

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,400
 king and your opponent's king must capture your queen before the game ends.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,600
 Fine, we get a 179 from Denmark.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,640
 With premiumed membership.

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,000
 E4.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,840
 B6.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,600
 Not very aggressive.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
 King E2.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,960
 Alright, come at me woman.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,200
 Bishop E7.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,280
 Man, I pushed my king up and all he did was continuing with his own plan.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,320
 Therefore, I'll push my king further.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,360
 There is no way he's not opening his queen now.

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,160
 Man, even the opening the queen move is not very aggressive.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,480
 F4.

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,640
 But it's fine, queen H4 of course.

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,280
 It seems like this guy is trying to do a challenge where he's only allowed to move once square.

18
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,640
 Knight C3.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,040
 Queen F6 and I'll resign.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,040
 Okay good.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,480
 H3.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,320
 Queen C5 check.

23
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,800
 Ah ha.

24
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,800
 Finally.

25
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,320
 A f***ing check.

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,320
 D4.

27
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,320
 Okay so since I cannot put my queen down for a queen trade, the only way my king can take

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,840
 his queen is that he has to blunder the woman.

29
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,080
 Well, I mean that also blunders the woman, but it's just not the way that I wanted it

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,280
 to be.

31
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,160
 I'll take the bishop instead.

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,600
 Okay that is very dangerous that he may resign after losing materials, but it's fine, I'll

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,480
 give him some materials back very quickly.

34
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:40,120
 And I mean who resigns the game after just losing a minor piece anyway.

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,040
 Right?

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,440
 Of course.

37
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,640
 Bishop C4.

38
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,880
 Let's give him some materials back as soon as possible.

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,840
 E D5 knight D5 knight D5 bishop D5 queen D5.

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
 Knight F3.

41
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,400
 Alright, 3 ways to blunder your queen, I'm happy with any of those.

42
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,080
 Sadly he's not a paid actor.

43
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,040
 Queen D3.

44
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
 Knight C6.

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
 C4.

46
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,080
 The plan is simple.

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,240
 Queen E6 check, king F2, he makes a random move, rook E1 skewering the royal couple,

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,960
 queen takes E1 desperado and my king takes his queen.

49
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,160
 Or he can just straight up blunder his queen and laugh into my face because I cannot take

50
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,840
 it.

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
 Queen B3.

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,720
 It's fine, I mean how hard can it be for me to take his queen with my king when he's

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,760
 keeping his queen in the middle of the board like this anyway.

54
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,640
 Queen takes F4 check.

55
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,580
 King D3.

56
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,200
 Knight takes D4.

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,880
 That blunders the queen again, but of course, I'll take this knight instead.

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:51,200
 Well, I guess now you can blunder your queen this way instead.

59
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,220
 This unpaid not actor is so not very convenient.

60
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,220
 Bishop E3.

61
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,040
 Aha, that bishop is very close now, you might want to take it.

62
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,420
 Or not.

63
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,760
 Rook HF1.

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,640
 I don't know, I'm out of ideas.

65
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,360
 F6.

66
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,320
 That blunders a bishop, C5 discover check.

67
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,480
 Rook blocks.

68
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,100
 C takes D6.

69
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,420
 At this point I'm pretty sure that this guy won't resign at all so I won't give back any

70
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,120
 materials anymore.

71
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,660
 C takes D6.

72
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,540
 Rook AE1.

73
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,540
 Rook E8.

74
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,980
 Aha, I can see this is our biggest chance so far in this entire game.

75
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,980
 Bishop F2.

76
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:40,000
 Ha, I'm attacking his queen, but if that queen runs away, rook takes E8 is a very obvious

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,160
 backrank checkmate in one, so one of the very few choices possible is that he can sacrifice

78
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,980
 his queen to take my horsey for a check, which finally allows me to finish this challenge.

79
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,400
 Or he can just blunder his queen again and just like the previous times I still cannot

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,960
 take it.

81
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,320
 King C3.

82
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,380
 Quite frankly, I don't think his position can get any worse than this.

83
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:10,760
 And he immediately proves me wrong, by blundering his queen, both of his rooks, and his king,

84
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,480
 at the very same time.

85
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,600
 You know, I'm not gonna play this game anymore.

86
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,800
 The video ends, have a great day.

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:33,600
