1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
 100 rated chess, but you can only move pieces and pawns, one square at a time. It sounds very

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:14,640
 tedious at first sight, but I think I have a way to make it entertaining. We get an exact 100 rated

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:24,640
 guy from France. E4. E6. Of course I'll play the French defense against a French. Knight c3. Aha,

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,840
 I think he feels offended after seeing me playing the French defense so he decided to play a

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:37,120
 very rare queen's knight variation. But guess what, I'll show him who's the boss here. King e7,

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:46,240
 the French defense, bong cloud variation. d3 d6 bishop g5 f6 bishop f4 bishop d7 queen e2.

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:54,320
 I really want to play g5 here, but of course, that ends the video. g6, knight f3 bishop g7

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:03,360
 long castle very aggressive c6 d4 a6 d5 cd5 e d5 b5. On second thought, maybe taking this pawn

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:12,480
 wasn't a right idea, but I think it's still fine. Knight takes e5. Oh wow, I can't believe a 100

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:18,400
 rated guy can actually seize that my f-pawn is pinned to my king, so he decided to sacrifice

11
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,280
 a knight for 2 pawns to attack my king. D takes e5, of course queen takes e5 next.

12
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:37,440
 Why is he thinking for so long? Yeah, that's why. That blunders a bishop. Of course I'm not just

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,240
 gonna make an exception for the knight because that sounds like what a coward is gonna do,

14
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:50,080
 and I will win this challenge without any horses. d6 check. King f7. I mean pulling him back may

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,280
 sound like a better idea, but I need my king in the middle of the board, because in this challenge,

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:04,720
 the king is just as strong as his wife. Rook d5. Very aggressive. Bishop e6. Free tempo baby.

17
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:12,800
 Rook takes e5 bishop takes e5 queen takes e5. Ah ha, now his queen is targeting my rook in the

18
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,480
 corner and there is no way for me to defend him, but actually, since I cannot move any horses this

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,880
 game, my rooks also don't get many chances to join in the battle. Therefore, let's not care about

20
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,320
 that. Let's trade my useless rook to take this very dangerous pawn in the middle of the board.

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,480
 Or not. a5. I mean it seems like he's about to go queen f6 check which is very dangerous to my

22
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,400
 video, but he should be able to see, that queen f6 is just blundering a queen. Right?

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:52,480
 So since queen f6 is bad, he decided to go there with his knight.

24
00:02:53,520 --> 00:03:01,680
 Queen c6. Man this guy is totally unexpectable. That move included. That blunders a woman.

25
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,200
 I mean if he can take my knight right now to help developing my rook, that will be very convenient.

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:15,520
 Sad. This video is getting pretty long, so let's try to win this game real fast.

27
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:24,800
 Rook a7 h4 b6 h5 who cares about that side queen takes d6 h takes g6 rook b7 g takes h7 rook c7

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:32,480
 h pawn changes gender oh no dude i was so focused on attacking his king and totally blunder my woman

29
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,920
 after rook takes g8 rook h6 checks curing the royal couple well who cares anyway rook g8 rook

30
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:48,560
 h6 king forward of course and now he'll take my queen why is he thinking for so long

31
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:58,800
 i solemnly swear that this guy is not a paid actor king forward again my king is just as strong as

32
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:11,760
 my queen in this game f3 king f4 all right no more checks never mind i'll take this pawn rook f5

33
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:19,440
 that blunders a horsey bishop e2 that blunders a rook do just please stop blundering your pieces

34
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,680
 and let me checkmate your king bishop c4 queen c5 oh no my rook bishop takes my rook oh no

35
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,720
 oh no my rook indeed because i cannot checkmate him from three squares away

36
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,400
 but actually f*** the rules queen takes c2 checkmate and since i ended my own video

37
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:52,640
 there is no what the f*** today

38
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,220
 (joyful music)
