 100 rated chess, but you cannot checkmate until your king visits all four corners of the board.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:19,600
 Wow. Impossible. We get a 2 1 1 from Australia. With diamond membership. E4. E5. So in order to

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,920
 be able to move my king around, I believe that the most important thing right now is development.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,680
 I'm planning to gambit 2 pawns for a head lead in development, castle my king, and then go to

5
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:40,960
 this corner first. Nevermind. That move ruined my entire plan. But anyway. Knight c3. Well I mean

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,240
 with his queen out like this, there are also a lot of chances that I can develop my pieces with

7
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:57,920
 free tempos. Knight c6. Not very aggressive. Knight f3. Queen back to f6. Ah ha, now knight d5

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,160
 queen d8 e takes d5 is obviously the best continuation, but that will keep his queen safe,

9
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,520
 and since I will have to move my king around the board, I think that it's better to keep his queen

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:19,680
 out in the open. Therefore, bishop g5, this way, his queen cannot go back to d8. Queen g6. Knight

11
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:28,720
 b5 looks really strong, but I'm kinda scared about a counterattack. So I guess. D5. Knight d4.

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:40,160
 I'll take this pawn. Queen takes g5. Queen takes d4. D6. Ah ha, now there is queen a4 check,

13
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,320
 which forces king e7, but in such situation, I strongly believe that he will blunder his king

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,880
 to bishop d7 and queen takes d7 mate, but since I haven't moved my king around the board yet,

15
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,400
 I cannot deliver such check mate, which means the situation will actually become that both my queen

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,800
 and my knight are under attack. Therefore, I guess I'll have to go with, knight back to f3.

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:13,600
 Bishop g4. That blunders a woman. But should I even take it, though, because if I take his queen,

18
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,400
 he will be very sad, and will also be down 10 points in materials,

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,480
 which may lead to an instant resignation, which is against the rules.

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,280
 You know what? I think it's fine. Knight takes g5. As a wise man once said,

21
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,960
 no man abandons his battlefield, just because of a woman.

22
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:49,120
 What the fo- Oh, wait. The mission said that I have to move my king before a checkmate,

23
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,120
 but there were no checkmates this game, so I guess. Mission. Kinda accomplished.
