00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 I'm better than my viewers. Bow and arrow. Let's go. Welcome to another episode of I'm

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,400
 better than my viewers, and today's challenger is a guy called Zach, and right here we can see that

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,440
 he's saying something that seems to be very knowledgeable. The net was a step forward,

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:25,760
 the web is a step back. Very cool. I'll take this bishop. There is no way that was not the best move.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,600
 E3. Ah ha, since I'm having too many same color bishops, let's just reduce their number.

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:43,200
 F takes E3. Bishop takes E3. Queen takes E3 will be very convenient. Not very convenient. Knight

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,440
 takes B takes bishop dates. Man, this game is so simple that I can't even think of anything to say

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,400
 to make the video longer, all the moves were so obvious that there is no way I can make any

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:02,320
 progress. Bishop takes H2. Rook H takes H2. This is actually really bad, because all I have are

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,160
 just some useless same color bishops, some horses that are not even active, so if he takes all of my

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,200
 rooks now, there is no way I can checkmate him because I have no idea how to checkmate with

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,320
 bishop and knight. And yet he took one more rook. Rook takes. Well I guess it's fine, I still have

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,800
 a pawn here that can change gender in the future. Nevermind. Taking this pawn is fine, but I'll go

14
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,440
 for rook G3. This guy is 1100 rated, so as long as he doesn't move his queen away from this square,

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:37,600
 I'm confident to say that he will definitely blunder that woman in the near future.

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:46,000
 Bishop takes F1. Bishop takes F6. Alright, how about knight D5 to attack my bishop,

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,720
 that looks like a great move. He wants a check first. King C1 is just way too dank,

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:59,840
 so king E1 is kinda forced. Knight D5 is best move, for me. That blunders a woman.

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:08,320
 Bishop takes B6 check. Knight takes B6. Rook takes D3 check. Well, I mean it's actually not even that

20
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,120
 good because if he takes my rook now, I don't really have anything to checkmate him anymore,

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,680
 so if he can just ignore this rook for 1 move, that will be very convenient.

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:26,240
 I'll take this pawn, and in this position, I offered a draw, because as I said, I don't know

23
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,880
 how to do knight and bishop checkmate, and apparently since my opponent also don't know

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:47,680
 how that thing goes, game drawn by agreement. Which is to say, I'm better than my viewers.

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,280
 (upbeat music)

26
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,800
