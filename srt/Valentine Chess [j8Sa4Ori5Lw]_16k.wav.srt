 Valentine chess. If you can feed your opponent's queen with a piece or pawn, you have to.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,240
 And of course, I cannot take my opponent's queen because that would make it too easy.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:21,520
 Let's go, we get a 3 0 5 from Vietnam. E4, if he brings his queen out, that will make the video

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:30,240
 go very wrong very quickly. Therefore, H5, at least that stops queen H5 and queen G4, and about

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:39,680
 queen F3. Well, we can only hope that it won't happen. G4. Very aggressive, the rule said I have

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,840
 to feed his queen if I can do so. Therefore, H takes G4 is forced. Wow, I was planning to not

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,920
 let his queen out, but now it seems like I'm just provoking his queen to come out and ruin my video.

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:04,720
 Yeah. I hate this guy. Now I have to sacrifice my rook or my pawn, so of course, let's go for

9
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,920
 the pawn first, I mean there's always a chance that he's not gonna take it. Right? Nevermind.

10
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:19,600
 Rook H5 is forced. Oh, wait. I didn't realize that I can also sacrifice the pawns on the other

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:34,000
 side as well. My bad. Alright. It's fine, it's just a fat rook anyway. B5. Queen H8. Very aggressive.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,440
 Of course moving the knight away should be the best move, but sadly, I have to feed his queen

13
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:48,880
 if I can. So I guess. E5. I mean maybe he can take my pawn instead of my knight. Right? Maybe not.

14
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:57,200
 Wow. This guy is totally destroying me right now. Queen G5 is forced. F***.

15
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,960
 Is this guy a smurf? Now since I already have a free E pawn for him to take,

16
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,880
 I think we can all agree, that I don't have to sacrifice another piece.

17
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:18,960
 Bishop B7. You know, I think it's still winnable. Knight C3. Wait. I have an idea.

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,920
 Bishop E7. Since he didn't take my E pawn last move, I think he doesn't see that it's hanging,

19
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:33,440
 so I'm hoping for queen G8 check. Bishop F8 is forced, queen back to G5, bishop back to E7,

20
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:43,120
 and we repeat moves for a draw. Aha! Exactly as planned. Bishop F8. But wait,

21
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,080
 it's just step 1, step 2 is he needs to go back to that exact same square.

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,920
 Of course. Bishop back to E7. Haha! Let's have a draw my friend.

23
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
 You know what? I don't want to play this game anymore. F*** Valentine.

24
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,320
 This guy is obviously a smurf. And I'm just gonna end the video right here.

25
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,900
 (upbeat music)

26
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,480
 (upbeat music)

27
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,060
 (upbeat music)

28
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,640
 (upbeat music)
