 100 rated chess, but you are Santa Claus. You must give your opponent 8 presents,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,960
 which are free pawns and pieces. If he doesn't take the present, the video ends.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,560
 Ho ho ho ho. We get a 2 1 5 from India. In case you don't know, there are not that many

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,160
 Christians in India. Which is to say, that this challenge is probably not going to go well.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:34,640
 E 4. E 5. Nothing wrong so far. Knight F 3. Ah ha, I should obviously give him this pawn as the

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,440
 first gift, but since there is always a chance that he won't take it. B 5. Ha, if I give him

7
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,920
 2 free pawns, there's no way he's not taking at least one of them. Right? Yes. Giving him this

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:57,040
 pawn next is perfect, but again, there is a chance that he doesn't even see it. Therefore, queen F 6.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,720
 Ok, since I'm attacking his knight, I'm actually not giving away this pawn,

10
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,240
 so in case he doesn't take it, the video still survives.

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,560
 I totally did not anticipate that move. That pawn cannot be counted as a gift because I didn't plan

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:21,680
 to give it away, and now I'll play. A 6. The idea is that I don't think he can see my pawn hanging,

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,680
 so I'll stop giving away that pawn, but I'll give away my rook instead.

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:36,960
 2 down, 6 to go. Bishop B 7. Queen H 5 check. Man, I totally didn't notice that his queen can

15
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,480
 also fork my pawn in the corner. G 6. Ok, even if he doesn't take my pawn, it does not end the

16
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:51,680
 video because as I said before, that was actually my blunder, and definitely not a gift. Knight takes

17
00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:00,800
 G 6. H takes G 6. Queen F 3. Trading queens when being down in materials doesn't sound very tempting.

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:09,680
 Queen back to D 8. E 5. That blunders a queen. Ok, last time I take my opponent's queen,

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,040
 my opponent resigned, but in this game, I've already given away a lot of materials,

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,520
 and after he takes my bishop, I'm literally only up 1 point in materials,

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,840
 so there's absolutely no need to resign.

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:32,640
 E 6. Ah ha, I can pull my bishop back, but I'll go for. D takes E 6. This means that I'm giving

23
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,800
 away my bishop as a gift, so if he doesn't take it, the video ends, but since my bishop makes him

24
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
 maidenless, there's no way he's forgiving it twice. Right?

25
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,000
 What the f-

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:04,560
