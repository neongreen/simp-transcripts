00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,560
 100 rated chess. But can't we have a normal chess? Having a normal game of chess from time to time

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,120
 ain't so bad right? In fact, not just this guy, but there have been like a thousand people telling

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,920
 me to make a video like this ever since the start of this channel. Well, so even though I absolutely

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,640
 don't see where the fun is in such video, let's just see how it goes. An absolutely normal chess

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:36,800
 game against an absolutely normal opponent. E4. Absolutely normal opening move. D5. Well most

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,040
 people don't play Scandinavian in an absolutely normal chess game, but you know, it's still an

7
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:51,120
 absolutely normal chess opening. Knight F3. K, I know that most people will just take the pawn in

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,280
 an absolutely normal chess game, but I like this opening more when I play against a 100 rated

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:06,240
 opponent. And by the way, that is still a book move. E5. Ah ha, he decided to go from the

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,720
 Scandinavian defense to the elephant gambit, which is of course, still an absolutely normal chess

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,680
 opening. Except the fact that I think this opening sucks. Let's take this pawn. And of course,

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:28,080
 capturing a pawn is also an absolutely normal behavior in a chess game. Knight F6. Let's take

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,960
 this pawn too. Taking 2 pawns in a row doesn't seem very normal at all, but you know, it does

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:45,920
 happen sometimes. Queen takes. A pawn trade, which is again, absolutely normal. D4. Protecting my

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:54,400
 knight against an attack is also normal. Bishop F5. C4. Attacking a queen in the middle of the

16
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:03,440
 board is definitely also very popular in chess. Bishop D6. Well, I think blundering a queen is

17
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:10,960
 not really a normal thing in a chess game, but you know, it does happen sometimes. C takes D5.

18
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:19,200
 Bishop takes E5. Ah ha. Normally you wouldn't want to trade when you're down in materials,

19
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,720
 but since my knight was very strong in the middle of the board, I think that was also a kinda normal

20
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,400
 decision to be made. D takes E5. Losing both center pawns, the queen, and allowing the opponent

21
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,680
 to have both center pawns with a very big center is not something that normally happens in a normal

22
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:47,600
 chess game, but again, it does happen sometimes. Knight FD7. And a resignation. Resigning is also

23
00:02:47,600 --> 00:03:05,520
 a very normal behavior when your position is too bad. So I guess. Mission, accomplished.

24
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,120
 (upbeat music)
