00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
 Day 12,000,300

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:06,940
 No. That's a lie. No one can live that long. Shame on you.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:19,800
 Alright. 100 rated chess, but open files, and half open files, paralyze any pieces, and pawns, on that same file.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,400
 For those of you who don't know, an open file means a file that doesn't have any pawns,

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,800
 and a half open file means a file that only have pawns of the same color.

6
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,800
 And with that out of the way, let's start the game. We get a 2-2-2 from the US.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,300
 With diamond membership.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,000
 Man, I feel like every single American bought the membership for some reasons.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,600
 E4, pushing pawns in a pawn challenge sounds like a really bad idea, but you know, a real man never run away from a challenge.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,800
 E5, knight F3.

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:06,600
 F6. That blunders a pawn, but in my experience, every time I take that pawn, my opponent usually take back,

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,300
 which blunders a rook to queen H5 G6 queen takes E5 forking the king and rook.

13
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,500
 But sadly, in that position, my opponent doesn't have the E pawn anymore, which means the E file is half open,

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,000
 which means everything on the E file must not move, which means my queen cannot take his rook.

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,500
 So I guess, bishop C4, there's no reason to risk the entire video just because of a free pawn.

16
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:42,000
 Knight H6. D3. The plan is simple, win the game without losing any pawns, or taking any pawns.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,200
 A6. Not very aggressive. I'll take this horsey.

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,700
 After G takes H6, the G file will become a half open file, which means everything on that file must not move,

19
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,500
 but you know, there aren't many things on that file anyway.

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:07,200
 B5. Ah ha, that blunders a pawn, but if his bishop takes, that will put his bishop on a half open G file,

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,000
 which is not good for the video, and if I save this bishop, B takes will make his B file half open

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 and then a move like knight C6 will immediately end the video.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,700
 Therefore, bishop B3 is kinda forced.

24
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,000
 Forgive me dark bishop, I have to let you die.

25
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
 Or not.

26
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,000
 Bishop takes F8. Alright, now that bishop will die for real.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:38,500
 Rook takes. Castle. It's a miracle that we're already at move 8 but no pawns have died yet.

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:46,000
 C5. He obviously wants to go C4 to attack my bishop, and even though it blunders a pawn,

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 big chance that he doesn't see that.

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:57,000
 Therefore, A3. With this move, I'm trying to tell him that even if C4 happens, my bishop can always retreat.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Yeah, he saw it.

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Bishop D5. Alright, now please stop pushing pawns for no reason.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 Bishop B7. That blunders a bishop. Perfect situation, I got into his territory, without killing any pawns.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,500
 K7. I'll go back, and with my bishop causing chaos in his territory, there's no way he'll continue to move his pawns.

35
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,500
 Nevermind. I'll take it.

36
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,000
 Oh, wait. I obviously should've pushed.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,500
 Well, my bad, but I think it's fine.

38
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:44,000
 C takes before. Yeah, now the A file and C file pieces and pawns must not move,

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 but since he doesn't have anything on the C file, that file is trash, and about the A file,

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,500
 well, beginners don't move their rooks a lot, and a move like A5 doesn't make any sense.

41
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,000
 Therefore, no worries.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Knight D2.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Knight D7. Knight B3.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,500
 It's fine, everything is still under control.

45
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,000
 Or not.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 What the f-

47
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 What the f-

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:29,000
