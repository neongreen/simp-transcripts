 100 rated chess, but your opponent's pawns caught covid. If a piece, or pawn, is next to a pawn,

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,960
 it can't move anymore. Very challenging. We get a 1 17 from India. With diamond membership.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,560
 Pushing center pawns only provokes him to push his pawns back, which freezes my pawns. Therefore,

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:33,200
 knight f3. At least I can prevent e5. Maybe not. That blunders a pawn, but do I even take it,

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,160
 though? If I take his pawn, d6 will attack my knight, and since my knight is next to his d-pawn,

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,720
 I cannot move it away, which means I'll lose a horsey. So I guess, I'm not gonna be greedy.

7
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:53,360
 E4. On second thought, maybe it doesn't matter whether my pawns are frozen or not,

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:02,160
 it's just about the pieces. Queen e7. Very aggressive. d4. Let's be hyper-aggressive and

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,000
 win this game fast, because my king is obviously useless in the endgame, where he cannot capture

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,680
 any pawns due to the rules. d5. Again, very aggressive. d takes e4 will freeze my knight,

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:27,520
 and thus winning it in the next move. Therefore, knight d2. d takes d4. Ah ha, I want to take this

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:36,240
 pawn back, but that may provoke c5, which freezes my knight and win it. So I guess, c4. I mean d

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,720
 takes e4 wins this knight, but there's nothing I can do about it anymore. And in fact, losing a

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:51,840
 knight like that is not too bad, when I can get rid of his center pawn. Queen c5. Knight b3. Now

15
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,640
 don't tell me that he's gonna take right here to freeze my knight instead of moving his queen.

16
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:07,920
 Of course. That blunders a woman. Ha! Now the mission is much easier. d takes c4. Knight takes

17
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,960
 d4. In this position, my knight on d4 is frozen, but after he takes my knight, I can move this

18
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:23,440
 knight again, and then he doesn't have any center pawns anymore. Or he can just resign. Mission

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
 accomplished.
