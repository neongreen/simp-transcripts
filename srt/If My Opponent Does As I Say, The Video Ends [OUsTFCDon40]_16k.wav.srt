1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 if my opponent follows my lead. The video ends. Okay, so basically, I will suggest a move to my

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,800
 opponent after every move, and if he really plays that move, the video ends. We get a 174 from Peru.

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,400
 Since this mission requires time for me to type a message and send to my opponent,

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:29,840
 I changed the time control to 10 minutes rapid. Also, longer time control will also lower the

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,920
 chance that my opponent makes a move faster than I give out a suggestion.

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,840
 Knight c3. I didn't take any guesses on my opponent's first move because every move could

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:51,280
 have happened. And I'm not a coward. E5. Now the safest suggestion has to be knight back to b1,

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,800
 since no one does that in the first place, but of course, that is a coward move,

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:04,320
 and since I'm not a coward, I think I'll go with a3. I mean who pushes their flank pawn in the

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:17,120
 opening anyway. Right? H4. Well I guess everything has an exception. D5. Since he plays h4, he's most

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:26,800
 likely planning to go rook h3. Therefore, I'll go with, rook h2. Oh wait typo. There you go.

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:38,560
 D4. Very aggressive. Bishop b4. And my suggestion, king d2. I mean I can just suggest moves like

13
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:47,520
 knight d5 since they are illegal, but of course, that is coward. a3. I'll take his knight.

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,680
 Suggesting queen d2. I mean queen d2. Typing mistakes are inevitable, since I have to type

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:03,360
 fast before he can make a move. b takes. Man, this is much harder than I thought.

16
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,520
 My right hand is holding my mouse to play the game, so I can only type with my left hand,

17
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,800
 and at the same time, I have to simultaneously think about playing the game wisely and which

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:23,920
 move to suggest to my opponent. But anyway. e takes d4. My safest suggestion has to be king d2.

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,000
 But since I have already used king d2 as a suggestion before, if I use it again now,

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,760
 then from now on, I can just repeat king d2 king d2 king d2 king d2. And the video will become very

21
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:46,320
 boring. Therefore, let's make another rule, that I cannot go with the same move, twice. Rook k2.

22
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:56,400
 c takes d4. Knight c6. Bishop h6. Blundering a bishop looks kinda fun too.

23
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,960
 e3. And so he chose to close down his bishop instead.

24
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,360
 Alright then. Knight f6. Bishop a6 looks very similar.

25
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,760
 e4. That blunders a pawn. g4. I believe that he's not that aggressive.

26
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:30,800
 f3. Let's play safe. Knight d6. He's not gonna play f4. I mean who pushes a pawn 1 square and

27
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:44,320
 1 square anyway. Right? A lot of people are going to say. You did that on purpose. Because I already

28
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:52,800
 saw him pushing e3 and then e4. But anyway. What the f

29
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,380
 (upbeat music)

30
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,960
 (upbeat music)

31
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,540
 (upbeat music)

32
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,120
 (upbeat music)

33
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
 Coochie coo, coochie coo, coochie coo
