00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 100 rated chess, but if your opponent acts like a paid actor, the video ends.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,520
 And since everyone has been talking about this paying actors stuff, let's just say,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:20,160
 or unpaid. Let's go. We get a 191 that is not an actor from Serbia. An actor would start the game

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,680
 by a random move on the sides of the board, so if he starts the game by a normal center move,

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,360
 that will prove that he's not a paid actor. Well, I guess he's just one of those guys who

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,640
 like to play the carders opening. E5. Alright, this time he will definitely make a normal center

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:50,720
 move, and not another random pawn push. Aha, I actually didn't realize, that g4 is a book move.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,920
 Yeah. Trust. Bishop e7. Alright, according to what he's been doing until now, he's obviously

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,360
 planning to go f4 next, but since that is blundering bishop h4 check rotates h4 is 4

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,360
 queen takes h4 checkmate in 2. A normal person will definitely abandon his plan of randomly

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:20,320
 pushing pawns forward. Well, I think that we can all agree, that everyone blunders their king every

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,320
 now and then, so this is just a normal case where my opponent just carelessly blunders his king,

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,800
 and he is definitely not a paid actor. G5. I'm not going to checkmate him right now,

14
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,440
 just give me some time to prove to you guys that there is no way this guy is an actor.

15
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:46,000
 F takes g5. Ha! You see, he captured a free pawn, which is a move that creates advantages for his

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,280
 game. D5. E4. Finally, a center move. I'll take it, a paid actor would just blunder a

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,120
 horsey here or something like that, so if he doesn't make such move.

18
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:08,640
 Aha, that is obviously just a casual queen blunder, because you know, we all blunder our

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,040
 women sometimes, and that still happens even at the master level. Therefore, knight c6,

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,160
 I mean a paid actor would continue to blunder their queen,

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,000
 and a normal person will just take this pawn and call it an advantage.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:30,800
 Ha! Normal people for sure. Bishop e6, now he'll just play the game normally and there

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:46,000
 is no more crazy queen blunder for the rest of the game. Yeah. I'm done.

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,440
