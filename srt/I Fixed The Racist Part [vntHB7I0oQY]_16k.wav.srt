1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
 100 rated chess, but the light squares have minds, if you land on a light square, that

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,800
 piece, or pawn, becomes disabled.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,280
 Definitely not racist at all.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,200
 We get a 1 22 from India.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,240
 An impossible challenge, against an impossible opponent.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,160
 C4.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,360
 Half of my board is disabled.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,520
 E5.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,240
 Queen A4.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,880
 Very aggressive.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,840
 My dark square bishop is very important in this game, so developing him this way is very

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,080
 dangerous.

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,480
 G5.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,400
 D3.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,160
 Bishop G7.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,200
 G4.

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,320
 C5.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,640
 I don't know, just randomly pushing the pawns that I can push, and hope that something great

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,640
 will happen.

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,200
 E4.

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,600
 Knight C6.

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,640
 And since this knight is now on a light square.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,200
 It's dead.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,760
 Knight F3.

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,080
 Queen D6.

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,720
 Right after developing a knight, people normally develop their bishop.

27
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
 Exactly as planned.

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,200
 I'll take this pawn.

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,220
 I mean it's actually very risky as my queen cannot change color.

30
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:21,520
 But I really need to take risks if I want the slightest chance to win this challenge.

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,720
 Queen back to D1.

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,860
 Very weird.

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,800
 I'll take this rook.

34
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,240
 Queen C2.

35
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,360
 That last pawn that can be pushed.

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,800
 A5.

37
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
 Knight D2.

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,280
 Ah ha.

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,640
 He's planning to trap my queen, and even though it normally wouldn't work as I can counter

40
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,040
 attack his queen, my knight is actually dead according to the rules.

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,560
 So I guess.

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,840
 I'll run.

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,920
 Man.

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,080
 It's actually pretty problematic as I don't really have many dark square moves left.

45
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
 Nevermind.

46
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
 Wow.

47
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:04,240
 And since the video is still so short, I'll answer some of your comments instead.

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,000
 Why not just restart the challenge with a new game and post that instead?

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,480
 You must be new to the channel, we don't do that here.

50
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,040
 Is that python colon o o o o?

51
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,320
 No it's a snake.

52
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:29,040
 That doesn't count in my eyes.

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,120
 So disconnecting is a new way of saying I failed the challenge but won't show it.

54
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,000
 You've known too much.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:49,860
