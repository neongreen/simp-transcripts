00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,560
 100 rated chess, but every time a piece. or pawn. dies, your queen must immediately visit

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,140
 file F to pay respects. I mean since there is no reason to pay respect to my opponent's

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,520
 pieces. Let's just say, that it only applies to my pieces.

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:26,040
 Let's go, we get a 140 from somewhere around the world. Or another world, I don't know.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:32,320
 E4. E5. Opening up the way for the queen to go to the F file should obviously be the first

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,920
 thing I have to do.

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,120
 Bishop C4. Knight C6. Nothing wrong so far, unless he decides to go bishop takes F7, which

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,600
 forces my queen to pay respect to my F pawn, but since it is a check, I cannot move my

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:56,000
 queen, which means I'll have to end the video, but I mean who plays like that anyway. Right?

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,480
 Queen G4. Aha! That blunders a piece to D5 double attacking his queen and his bishop,

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,000
 but based on my experience, D5 here will most likely get E takes D5, which blunders a queen,

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,080
 but since my pawn dies, my queen has to pay respect, and then he'll continue to take my

13
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,080
 knight, which blunders the queen again but force me to pay respect again, and then again

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,980
 and again until he has a new queen. Therefore, D6. Most people at this ELO will still blunder

15
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,360
 their queen this way though.

16
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:38,760
 This guy is such a smurf. Knight D4. Queen E3 allowing a triple fork will be very convenient.

17
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:47,120
 Wrong square. Alright, here we go. F5. E takes F5 will force queen F6, but since I need to

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,720
 open up the position, I'm willing to waste a move moving my queen.

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,300
 Knight F3. I'll take his pawn then. And I've just realized that I've blundered a horsey

20
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:06,220
 because after queen E4, queen F6 paying respects is forced, and then he can take a free horsey.

21
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:13,820
 Knight takes D4. Wow! That blunders a queen, but queen F6 is forced. This guy actually

22
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,220
 found an even better way to capture, because this way he not only can win my knight, but

23
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,820
 also can laugh into my face because I cannot take his blundered queen due to the rules.

24
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:32,060
 Ha! Nevermind. Now that really blunders a woman. And for the challenge's sake, let's

25
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,900
 just say that after he takes my pawn, I'll have to move my queen to another square on

26
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,980
 the F file, because keeping the queen on the F file to pay respect to everyone sounds like

27
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,540
 a cheap way of cheating.

28
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,420
 Resignation.

29
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,100
 Mission accomplished.
