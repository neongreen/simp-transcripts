 100 rated chess, but you like drawing, you offer a draw every time your opponent makes a blunder.

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,400
 If the draw is accepted, you draw a picture of Arnish Jeevy. This is going to be short.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:24,240
 E4. D5. I'll take it. Queen takes. Okay. Here we go. Queen h5. The plan is very simple.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,480
 From playing a countless number of games against the 100 rated players,

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,680
 I have come to realize that no matter how hard I try, they will always make a massive blunder at

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,200
 some point during the game, therefore, I will sacrifice my queen first, so that after my

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,720
 opponent has a big lead in material, he will not accept my draw offer after he makes his blunder.

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:52,800
 And then he didn't take my queen. This video is going very wrong very quickly. Missing my queen

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:01,120
 can also be considered as a blunder, therefore, draw offer. He refused it. Queen takes f7.

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:10,480
 I mean if he goes king d7 here, I'm down to just resign this game. Thank you. Knight f3. Alright,

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:18,240
 now let's proceed to checkmate him. King e8. Bishop c4. The idea is knight e5, he makes a

12
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:27,600
 random move, I offer a draw, he declines the draw, bishop f7 mate. Knight c6. That prevents knight e5,

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:36,960
 therefore, d4. In no world do you take it with your queen here. No doubt. Knight e5. Oh no my rook.

14
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,120
 Knight takes c2 check. King f1 is blundering a king, therefore, king e2 is kinda forced.

15
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:53,200
 Knight takes a1. Ah ha, that blunder's bishop f7 checkmate in one, but since it is a blunder,

16
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,240
 I have to offer a draw first. Well I mean even if he agrees to the draw right now,

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,280
 it is still fine because I get to show my spectacular skill at drawing Mr. Jiri,

18
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,080
 and if he declines the draw, we have a longer video. It's an absolute win win.

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,440
 Draw declined. Ha, now checkmating is great, but since he took a long time but didn't see

20
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,160
 the checkmate threat, I suppose I can make the video a little bit longer. Rook d1. Longer video

21
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,200
 means more ads revenue, but of course I will checkmate him next move since it is too risky

22
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:34,960
 to let it last longer. G5. Draw offer. I mean since he didn't accept it the last time,

23
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,400
 there is no reason to accept it this time. Right?

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:57,920
 So, perfect.

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:13,440
