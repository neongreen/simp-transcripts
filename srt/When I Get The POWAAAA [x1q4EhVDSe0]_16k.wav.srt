00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 100 rated chess, but you reveal the challenge whenever you want to.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,560
 This is the first time in this entire channel that I get to choose how the challenge is going to happen,

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,480
 and of course, there is no way this is a loss, we get a 100 rated victim from Australia.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,080
 E4. Well, I guess we just play normally until I have a confirmed

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,040
 checkmate sequence and then I'll uncover the challenge.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,000
 E5. Let's try something fun. F4. King's gambit baby.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,360
 Queen H4 check. Moving king forward sounds a bit too much fun. G3. And I'm not a coward.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:54,640
 Queen F6. D4. He takes that way. E5. Queen G5. Bishop takes F4. The fact that he refused to

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,360
 bring his queen back or just simply move her to the other side makes me pretty sure that he's

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:08,400
 going to blunder his queen. Right now. There we go. Queen takes H5. And let's just hope that the

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,000
 challenge doesn't involve my opponent's queen, I mean who the f*** writes a challenge like that anyway.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:22,880
 G6. Queen F3. And also hope that it doesn't ban going backwards, I mean people did gave a

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
 challenge like that before, so no one should be copying that again.

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,720
 Bishop H6. Bishop C4. Bishop takes queen takes.

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:44,080
 D6. Ah ha, that blunders queen F7 king D8 queen F8 king D7 E6 king C6 queen F3 king B6 queen B3

16
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:51,280
 king C6 queen B5 a very textbook and easy to see checkmate in 6 moves. And as promised before,

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,400
 I will be uncovering the challenge when I have a confirmed checkmate per 10. Therefore,

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,200
 you must checkmate within the next 2 moves.

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,760
 How am I supposed to checkmate in 2? When there is a checkmate in 6.

20
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:16,960
 Oh well, I guess I'll play 2 more moves. And now I'll answer some comments instead.

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,680
 What's a skewer in chess context? It's actually very rare to see a serious question in my comment

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,600
 section, so I will try to answer this comment in the most optimal way possible. Google it.

23
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,800
 Simp should use the YouTube money to get better wifi. Not enough.

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,840
 I don't believe you, I bet you like to stab people IRL.

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,840
 Only half true, I only like to stab girls with my meat.

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:58,720
