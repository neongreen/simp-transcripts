00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
 100 rated chess, but your piece is, not pawns, a coward, a piece can only move if another

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,800
 ally piece is touching them for encouragement, or else they will freeze in fear.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,080
 Sounds absolutely impossible, but of course, I'm not a coward, we get a 1 54 from Mexico.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:29,200
 D4. E5. E3. Not very aggressive. I'll take this pawn. Again,

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:38,960
 the challenges rule does not apply on the pawns. Queen takes. Ok. Here we go. Knight c6. I mean

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,480
 my knight actually can not take his queen because there are no pieces next to him for encouragement,

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,280
 but I guess it's not like he's gonna blunder his queen right now just to piss me off anyway.

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:01:01,040
 Queen e4 check. Bishop e7. Bishop c4. Very aggressive. Knight f6, for the video's sake,

9
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,160
 let's just say that this bishop is also next to this horsey, which means that if he blunders his

10
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:15,120
 queen right now, I can move this knight to take it. Too bad he's not a paid actor. D5. A paid

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:23,760
 actor will take this pawn for sure. And that once again proves that he's not a paid actor. Bishop d6.

12
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,280
 You may be wondering why I'm making such a weird move, I'll suggest you to take a guess and then

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:38,320
 continue to watch the video. Knight e2. Ladies and gentlemen, his queen is trapped. Oh. Wait.

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,480
 I've just realized that if he makes a desperado now and take my bishop, I actually cannot take

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:51,040
 back because this knight is a coward. Man, I was so focused on trapping his queen and completely

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:58,080
 forgot about the challenge. Well, I guess it's good when he didn't take my bishop, but now he's

17
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:05,840
 threatening a scholar's checkmate in 1. Therefore, queen d7. I mean after queen f7 queen f7, bishop

18
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,600
 f7 is a check, which means I'll have to move my king, but since there is no ally piece next to my

19
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,200
 king, I'll have to end the video, but he should be able to see, that he'll be blundering a bishop

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:29,440
 with those moves. Right? Ha. Doubters. My king is next to my queen, therefore, he can move. Some

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,480
 people may say that I broke the rules by moving my rook when there was no piece next to him,

22
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,520
 but the fact is I only move my king, the rook just magically moved along with him,

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,920
 I take no responsibility for that. Knight f4, that blunders a horsey.

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,640
 He takes f4, that blunders a king. Queen to d1, checkmate.

25
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,520
 Wow. Things just got unbelievably convenient for those last few moves.

26
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:14,320
