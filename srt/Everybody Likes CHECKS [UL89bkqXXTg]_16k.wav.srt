 100 rated chess. But checks are forced. This is going to be short. We get a 165 from Brazil.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,400
 In case you are wondering why there are some weird shapes around the Brazilian flag right here,

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,640
 it's because I'm recording today's video using Microsoft Edge, not Google Chrome like usual,

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,160
 because there seems to be something wrong with my Google Chrome today.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:32,880
 E3. Pushing E5 is very natural, but if he plays D4 next, it will make Bishop B4 check forced,

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,760
 and after C3, I will have to sacrifice my Bishop, because that is also a check. Therefore,

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,960
 Knight F6. I mean D5 obviously allows Bishop B5 check, and there is always a chance that he won't

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:59,360
 play it. Queen E2. Very aggressive. Knight C6. Queen D3. Aha, now there is Queen takes D7 check,

9
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,800
 and since he's obviously not going to play that, D6. The plan is very simple. Not allowing any

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:14,160
 checks, and if there is no possible check, the video cannot end. And it's going to be really

11
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:20,960
 hard if he keeps moving his queen around threatening my video like this. E5. My dark

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:29,760
 bishop is already blocked, so there's no reason not to take some center space. Queen F3. Aha,

13
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,760
 now there is Queen takes C6 check, and once again, he's definitely not going to do that.

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:45,600
 Therefore, Bishop D7. Knight C3. Bishop E7. Once I can castle, we can finally play the game

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:55,280
 normally. Queen G3. Wow. Now if I castle, there is Queen takes G7 check, but since it blunders a

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:03,680
 queen, he's not going to play that, which means the video ends. So I guess, Knight H5. Well,

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,240
 at least there is no possible check right now, so he can't end my video, no matter how hard he tries.

18
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:18,080
 Queen back to F3. Queen takes F7 is a check, therefore, Knight back to F6.

19
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:26,640
 Ha! Very aggressive. Knight back to H5. This challenge is really hard,

20
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:35,200
 so I'll take a draw anytime I can. Yes. Knight back to F6. Draw by repetition.

21
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,600
 Mission kinda accomplished.

22
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:54,240
