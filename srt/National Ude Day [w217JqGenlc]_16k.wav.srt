00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
 It's the 14th of July, aka the United States National N*** Day.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,560
 And yes I also cannot believe YouTube demonetizes a word that is used for a national holiday.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,840
 But anyway.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,040
 100 rated chess, but opponent's queen doesn't have clothes on,

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,600
 my pieces and pawns must not look at her.

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,160
 Sounds easy enough.

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
 We get a 1-0-3 from Greece.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,760
 E4.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,160
 For those of you who are wondering why my queen isn't included in the challenge.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,160
 I also don't know.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,320
 E5.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
 D4.

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,320
 Queen g5 immediately makes my bishop gone blind and ends the video.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,560
 But who plays like that anyway?

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,760
 Right?

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,360
 No doubt.

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,800
 Capturing this way is obviously dumb.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,720
 I'll capture this way instead.

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,600
 He mimicked the capture.

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,120
 Queen takes.

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,160
 And in no world do you copy my move.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:07,200
 You know what?

23
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,720
 I changed my mind.

24
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,400
 Only my queen sees his queen, and as you might have thought,

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,560
 it is absolutely okay for a woman to see another woman n***.

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,080
 So the video continues.

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,080
 Queen a4 check.

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,800
 And I'm not cheating.

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,600
 Knight c6.

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,200
 There is no such thing as attacking the queen for a tempo.

31
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
 Knight f3 instead.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
 b5.

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,080
 That blunders a pawn, but it is too risky to create such a tactical position with his queen included.

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,160
 Avoiding is best.

35
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,800
 f5.

36
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,240
 Ah ha.

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,040
 He's probably planning to go queen e4 which forces a queen trade,

38
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,160
 and since the challenge needs his queen to operate,

39
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,680
 I cannot allow that to happen.

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,680
 I mean as long as he doesn't blunder his queen anymore,

41
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,160
 this video will be totally under my control.

42
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,880
 What the f-

43
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:23,520
