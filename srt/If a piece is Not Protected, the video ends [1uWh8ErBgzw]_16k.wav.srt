1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
 If a piece, not a pawn, is not defended, the video ends.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,760
 Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:18,800
 Actually, I have seen this challenge months ago, but haven't taken it yet, due to it being

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,680
 too hard.

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,920
 But today, is the day, that I will overcome my fear, and deliver a victory, over an impossible

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,120
 challenge.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:37,600
 Therefore, let's find an opponent.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,400
 We get a 1 97 from Columbia.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:46,720
 Now there are obviously 4 rooks in the corners that are not defended at all.

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,360
 But of course, there is nothing I can do about that.

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:57,080
 So let's just say, the starting position, doesn't, count.

12
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,640
 E4.

13
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,200
 Ah ha!

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:09,480
 In this position, bishop c4, bishop b5, queen g4, and queen h5, are all threats to my video.

15
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,380
 And of course, there is no way for me, or even Magnus Carlsen, to prevent all of them

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,560
 from happening.

17
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,560
 So I guess, d5.

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,280
 With this move, I can at least prevent bishop c4, and also give him a choice to capture

19
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,200
 my pawn, instead of moving his pieces.

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,240
 And you know, who develops their queen first anyway.

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,120
 Right?

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,720
 E takes d5.

23
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
 Yes.

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,360
 But now, once again, all of those 4 moves are threats to the video.

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,200
 Queen takes d5 looks like it stops the bishop, but sadly, that move ends the video itself,

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,560
 which makes me a fool.

27
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,520
 Therefore, e6.

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:07,920
 Since he decided to capture my pawn last time, there's no way he refuses it this time.

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,960
 Right?

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,960
 Yes.

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,000
 Bishop takes e6.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,540
 And with that, I have prevented queen g4 and bishop c4.

33
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:25,760
 Now please don't give a check, just because it's possible to do so.

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,760
 Knight f3.

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,980
 I'll be honest, this video is actually lasting longer than I thought it would.

36
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,300
 But anyway.

37
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:40,440
 Now there are knight d4 and knight e5 threats, so knight c6 looks pretty good.

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,920
 But if I play knight c6, it will only give him more reason to play bishop b5, which also

39
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,460
 ends the video.

40
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,180
 So I guess, queen d6.

41
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:56,540
 Oh wait, I should have played queen f6.

42
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,740
 Nah.

43
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:04,300
 Who cares, he's not gonna move his horsey to the side of the board.

44
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,700
 Right?

45
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,180
 Knight c3.

46
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,940
 Aha!

47
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,820
 He's obviously threatening to go knight b5, attacking my queen, and ending the video,

48
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,380
 at the same time.

49
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,820
 Therefore, a6.

50
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,300
 d4.

51
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:32,460
 That unleashed this bishop, so now knight g5 is no longer a threat.

52
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,740
 So I guess, bishop e7.

53
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,820
 Developing a piece, and also preventing knight h4.

54
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,540
 And with that, the only threat remaining is knight a4, which is obviously not going to

55
00:03:46,540 --> 00:04:01,700
 happen, therefore, I can guarantee you, that this video, is going to be, pretty, long.

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:01,980
 What the f-

57
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:16,540
