00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
 I'm better than my viewers, sus sus amogus. Very suspicious.

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,280
 Welcome to episode I stop counting of I'm better than my viewers,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,920
 and the challenger this time is a guy called Pumza Fun, with a rating of whopping 1500 rapid.

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,760
 See pawn changes gender is blundering queen e6 check king e a queen g a checkmate in two,

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,920
 but since he's 1500, there's no way he'll blunder his king on his very first move. Right?

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:36,080
 Of course, knight takes f4, and in this position, Pumza Fun actually spotted that he has a brilliant

7
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:42,400
 tactic, so he literally took nearly 2 minutes off the clock, and went for, c8 equals queen.

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:52,320
 Wow. Queen e6 king c7 queen c a checkmate from behind. And since the video is still so short,

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,840
 which is bad for the ad's revenue, we actually agreed to a rematch, I'm still playing black

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:06,800
 this game, e f4 knight f4 same thing as before, but this time, he decided to go. King c8. Coward.

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,680
 Taking with the queen is just telling him to run his king further away. Therefore,

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:19,040
 I'll take with knight. F takes g4. Honestly, I actually didn't even notice that he had a pawn

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:27,360
 targeting my bishop the entire time, somehow that was not even under my radar. King takes g4. d7.

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,720
 Man this looks so hopeless. Queen h7. Let's try to create some counterplay, and who knows,

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,720
 maybe he'll decide to be an unpaid actor for one more time. Bishop d8. Alright, somehow he decided

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,800
 to block both of his pawns ways to change their gender. I'll move my pawn then, if he's nice

17
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:56,640
 enough, he let David go all the way down and change his gender. David is dead. Rook g5,

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,600
 well at least I'll try to keep Edward alive, because he is pretty much my only hope for this

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:11,760
 game. And then he came for Edward. Edward f3. And he immediately went to c David. King g3. Alright,

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,120
 at this point, I'm sure there is no way for me to win this game anymore, so I did the thing that

21
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,440
 everyone does when they are losing. That is obviously. To offer a draw. And of course,

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,840
 since he has so much advantage that there is no way this game can be a draw,

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,840
 he logically accepted the offer. Therefore, I'm better than my viewers.

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:48,400
