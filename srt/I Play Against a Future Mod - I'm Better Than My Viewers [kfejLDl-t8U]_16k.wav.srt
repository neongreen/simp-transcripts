 I'm better than my viewers? Arrow. To me it looks more like a d***head. But anyway.

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,120
 Girls and boys and others, welcome to another I'm better than my viewers video, and today's

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:20,160
 viewer is a guy called Manos Sef. These knights are way too close to my king. I'll eliminate them

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:32,640
 first. B takes e6. d7 check. Knight B takes d7. E takes d7 check. King e7 blundering king f3

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,360
 discovered check knight e4 or takes e4 checkmate in two will be very convenient.

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,840
 Didn't happen. I don't know why Stockfish hates his move so much, but I'll take this knight

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:54,480
 regardless. Knight takes f6. Aha, that removes a defender of the king, Stockfish even goes as far

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,920
 as saying this is a forced mate in 9, and even though I cannot see this very difficult checkmate

9
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:08,880
 in 9 yet. Let's start with a check. Queen blocks. I'll take. Queen 7 takes e7 is blundering queen

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,080
 takes d8 a very cool checkmate in one with his king being checkmated while being right next to

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:23,520
 his wife. He didn't fall for it. I'll trade. And then he said. I'll do it for the content,

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:35,200
 put my next message in the video. I offer a draw. Good content. Knight takes d7. Rook takes d7.

13
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:45,200
 H takes g4. Aha, now king g2 will bring my king to absolute safety, but you know what? I'm not

14
00:01:45,200 --> 00:02:01,360
 a coward. G5 check. King takes g5. I will never retreat. Nevermind. Bishop sacrifice. Knight

15
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,520
 takes rook check. King over rook sac king takes. And at this point, everything is hopeless.

16
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,800
 I'm better than my viewers.
