1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 I'm better than my viewers, but I had to censor the name that this guy gave to his position because it sounds pretty racist in my opinion.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 Let's go.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Good morning everyone, welcome to another episode of I'm better than my viewers,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 the series that was made to prove that I'm better than my viewers, obviously because I'm better than my viewers,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 and today's challenger is a guy called Noobie.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 This woman is about to die and also helps the opposing pawn promote.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Therefore, queen takes d1.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Rook takes.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 One of the e-pawns changes gender.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Ha! Who's maidenless now?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 Bishop takes e2.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Man. This move actually says a lot of things about women these days,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 that this guy literally chose to be maidenless instead of getting a free queen.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 One of the b-pawns changes gender.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Well I mean it doesn't matter how hard life has been for him,

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 at the end of the day, he still needs a woman by his side if he wants to win this game.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 I'm sorry dude, but you really need to move on.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 D takes e5.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Since I'm having more queens, it's definitely good to open up the position.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 F takes e5.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 I'll take this way instead.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I have a reason for that.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 H takes g5.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Knight takes f7.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Ha! Now I'm targeting two weak pawns at the same time,

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 and there is nothing he can do to defend them.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 G-pawn changes gender.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 D-pawn changes gender.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 Somehow I have a feeling that he's gonna blunder one of these women right now

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 and make the game a bit more convenient for me.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 F takes g3.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 H takes g3.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 Let's try to break through.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 Queen g7 gf3 queen g5 f2 queen g3 f-pawn changes gender queen e5.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 And then we shuffle our pieces for a few moves more.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 In this very position, he went for

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 king d3.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 While king d2 also does the trick of opening up the c-file,

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 he decided to be a giga-chad and advance his king straight into the face of my women.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Queen takes e6.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 It's not too late to go back.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Nevermind.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Queen checks queen blocks queen takes queen queen takes queen queen takes queen.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Checkmate.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I'm better than my viewers.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:42,000
