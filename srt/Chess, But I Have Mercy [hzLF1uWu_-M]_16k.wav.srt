 100 rated chess, but you must tell your opponent when he blunders and let him keep that peace.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:14,160
 If he blunders twice, the video ends. Well, I guess we can say, not pawn.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:26,560
 This is going to be short. We get a 435 from Myanmar. e4, e5, still theory. Knight f3,

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:40,480
 d5, very aggressive. I'll take this pawn. Knight h6, d4, bishop d6. I'll take this knight.

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:50,400
 g takes, queen h5, castle. It's funny how he's been attacking my knight for like 10 moves,

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:59,840
 and still hasn't taken it yet. I'll take this pawn. c5. I'll take this pawn too. It's amazing

7
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:08,400
 how he's down 3 pawns already, but no pieces have been blundered yet. Queen a5 check. Very aggressive.

8
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:19,440
 c3. c takes d4. Bishop d3. Man, such a peaceful game for a video. I guess this is partly because

9
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:28,240
 my opponent is pretty high rated this time. Bishop takes e5. Ha! Most of my opponents blunders that

10
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,640
 piece is everywhere in my games, but then there comes this guy, who just straight up blunders his

11
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:47,920
 king, as his first blunder. That blunders a king. f4. I'll make him sacrifice his bishop to save

12
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,520
 his king. Oh wait. I should have made him sacrifice his queen instead. Oh well, who cares anyway.

13
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,400
 Ah ha! So he did sacrifice his bishop, but failed to save his king.

14
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,800
 And for those of you guys watching, feel free to pause the video to find the checkmate pattern

15
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,960
 for white, while I don't give you any seconds to do so, since I have to end the video.

16
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:38,960
