 100 rated chess, but it's take your child to work day.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,280
 Every fourth move you let your child make a move.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,600
 I don't have a child, so I actually invited my cousin over during the recording of this video.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,640
 And he's 9. We get a 123 from the Philippines.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,240
 E4. Not only my cousin is 9, he also knows how to play chess, but not that good.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,360
 So I actually don't know if that's a good thing or not.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,320
 But anyway. First move is my move. E5.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,200
 Bishop C4. I don't want to play too aggressively,

9
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,400
 because I don't know what will happen when it's my cousin's turn.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:49,840
 Therefore, I'll make a defensive move. Fun fact, I actually taught this cousin how to play chess,

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,400
 so I hope that he and I will make a great team.

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,240
 Knight C3. This is my last move before disaster strikes,

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,880
 so in order to prevent a crazy king E7, I'll block away my king.

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,680
 Ha! Now I don't have to worry about anything. Anymore.

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,680
 Except for that. My cousin's move, and I mean since I taught

16
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:24,800
 him how to play chess, he should be able to see, that this is a very obvious checkmate in one threat.

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,000

 Comment section time. Don't give up on this challenge,

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,880
 it seems like a fun one that keeps chess fresh. I actually prefer frozen stuff.

20
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,360
 I'm bad at chess, where was the first mate in 6?

21
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:51,040
 0 replies, and I mean everyone at average can see any checkmate patterns shorter than 27 moves,

22
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,960
 so if you want to get better, I would suggest you try solving that short and easy checkmate in 6 by

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,800
 yourself. I would have loved to see you play it out to the end, you weren't that much at a

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,200
 disadvantage, I would have been excited to see who wins. No.

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:20,560
 MMMMM. Great comment.

26
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,600
