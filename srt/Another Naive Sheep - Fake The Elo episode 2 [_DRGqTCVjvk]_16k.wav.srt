1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 *claps*

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Men and women, my name is Detective Simp, and welcome to episode 2 of Fake the Elo.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 The rules are simple. I play against a Discord member. He'll try his best to hide his elo. And I'll take a guess for his elo.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 So far, none of you guys have been able to hide your elo from me. And on the other hand, Detective Simp has been dominating the game until now.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 There were not even a draw. But anyway, enough talking. Let's go.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 This time, we get a guy from Malaysia. With a very long name.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 Man, I doubt that I can make the text-to-speech engine able to read that name out.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 But anyway. E4. E5. Still theory. D4.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Taking my pawn should be his best move, but a lot of beginners just listen to the Grandmaster's advice, of "Be careful when you take pawns in the opening."

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 And he listens to the Master's. With that move alone, I'm pretty sure that he's 800 rated or below, unless he wants to play badly to trick me.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 I'll take this pawn, knight takes and F4 then my position is great.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 Or not. I'll take that too. You know what they say, if black gambits a pawn, you should always take it.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
 Knight F6. Bishop G5. H6. Very aggressive. I'll go back.

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Bishop E7. Ah ha, I didn't take the knight because I don't like queen F6, but with the queen blocked out right now, I'll take it.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 Bishop takes. Queen H5 check. You see, if this place was his queen instead of his bishop, he would've had G6 to kick my queen back, instead of having to move his king now.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 There we go. But still, I think that was some pretty advanced stuff, so even though those tactics were cool, no info was gathered there.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Bishop C4. Let's see if he blunders checkmate.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 Of course not. And wait, I think I have a really cool idea.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 C3. That move blunders 2 pawns, is he gonna see queen take C4 forking my king and bishop, which forces queen back to E2 and then takes my G2 pawn,

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 or is he gonna think that his queen is defending checkmate so it cannot move?

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 He missed it. That should tell me something about his ratings.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 Knight D2. Fun fact, I blundered a piece here, feel free to pause the video right now to find the best move for black, while I don't give you any seconds to do so,

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 and the move was D5, and I'll have to sacrifice my bishop, unless I want my queen trapped by bishop G4.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 But anyway, he didn't see it either.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Knight takes C4. Queen F7 queen takes F7 check king takes his forced long castle rook E8 F3 B5 very aggressive knight E3 C6 knight E2 bishop G5.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Phew! Now rook D3 looks okay, or even king D2 looks really fun.

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 But you know, why not blunder a pawn, is he gonna see rook takes E4 counterattacking my knight and win a pawn?

28
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 No he didn't. Knight G3. Alright, I think that's enough for today, let's try to end this game.

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Rook D8 weird move rook HF1 G5 very aggressive F takes G5 discovered check king G7 knight EF5 check king G6 knight takes E7 check king G7 knight GF5 check king H7.

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 And even though there's rook D6 rook H6 checkmate. As a grandmaster once said. If you find a checkmate, look for a better one.

31
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Therefore, G6 check king H8 is forced G7 check king H7 is forced rook D6 the king can't move rook H6 checkmate.

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 Alright, now comes the hard part. To be honest, he actually missed out on every single tactics in the game, except the checkmate in one threat, so I suspect he's 700 maxed.

33
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 And as you saw in the thumbnail, he's just another guy being too honest. I'm guessing 667.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 Ha! The score is now 2... nil.

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 [Outro]
