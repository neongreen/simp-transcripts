00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 100 rated chess, but a peasant uprising is brewing. If there are any pawns alive at the

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,840
 end of the game, both players lose. Okay so technically I don't give a shit if my opponent

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:19,360
 loses or not, so this actually means, I lose. Great Worm Gold. I mean having a great worm is

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:26,880
 cool and all, but golding it, is not very suggested. E4. In order to let my pawns die,

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:35,360
 I need to push them. E5. Still theory. D4. Alright, the first conflict of the game,

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,240
 and if he can just capture all the way down to the B pawn, that will be very convenient.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:48,720
 Sadly he's not a paid actor. Knight F3. I'm sorry Edward, but you'll have to die sooner or later

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:59,440
 anyway. Edward is dead. Bishop E2. Take this pawn too please. Or not. C3. On second thought,

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,840
 maybe I should have blot with my knight to provoke him to take my pawn to attack my knight.

10
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,680
 There were three twos in that sentence. Bishop A5. Since he didn't want to take my pawn,

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,640
 I'll take his pawn instead. Both sides need to lose pawns, not just me.

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,840
 D6. I'll take that as well. Bishop B6. That sacrifices another pawn. Queen D8 checkmate in

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:34,160
 one by the way. Ah ha. Instead of taking my pawn back, he went for knight D7 blocking the queen's

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,640
 weight of the checkmating square, obviously to flex that he can see the checkmate threat.

15
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:47,760
 B4. Back to the pushing pawns plan. Bishop takes F2. That blunders a bishop, but the question is,

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,520
 do I even take it though? If I take it, I will have a 3 points material advantage, which may

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,440
 cause him to resign, but if I don't take it, that may mess up some special plans he has inside his

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,120
 mind when decided to sacrifice his bishop. And then also resign from the game, not to mention

19
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:11,440
 that my viewers are gonna call me a coward. So I guess, I have to take it. I mean it's fine,

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,080
 like who resigns just because they lose a bishop anyway. Right?

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,880
 [Bloopers]

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,880
 Well I actually saw that was coming, so there's no what the f*** today.

23
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:39,520
