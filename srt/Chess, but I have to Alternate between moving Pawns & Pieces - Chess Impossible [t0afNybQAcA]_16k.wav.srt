00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 chess, but you have to alternate between moving a pawn and a piece.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,300
 And since this guy's profile picture is all white,

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:14,260
 I had to switch my YouTube studio to the dark theme so that you guys can see his picture.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,160
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,680
 That was fast. We get a 148 from Argentina.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,440
 Let's start with a pawn move.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:36,340
 Knight f6.

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:44,280
 Normally, I would just push e5, but of course, it's time for a piece move.

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,360
 e5.

10
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,520
 f4. The Vienna Gambit, which I actually don't know anything about.

11
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,280
 He took the Gambit.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,320
 So I believe the best move now should be e5, kicking the knight back to its original square.

13
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,920
 But of course, I have to go with a piece move.

14
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,080
 d5. Aha! e5.

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,840
 Knight e4.

16
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,880
 Taking that horsey is obviously a huge blunder.

17
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,400
 So I guess,

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
 bishop e2.

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,600
 Oh, wait.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,720
 I blundered.

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,760
 Now if he chooses not to take my knight on c3,

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:40,160
 I'll make a pawn move next, and then if he takes my knight on his next turn,

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:47,360
 I'll have to move a piece, which means I won't be able to take his horsey back, which means I'll be down a piece.

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,480
 Thank God he took it.

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
 Just in time for a pawn move.

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:59,320
 Man, maybe I shouldn't have played with such an aggressive opening in the first place.

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,440
 Bishop g4.

28
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,040
 Very aggressive.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,560
 But that horsey is defended by both a piece and a pawn, which means if he takes it,

30
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,560
 I will be able to recapture, no matter what turn it is.

31
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,120
 Therefore, I'll just take a pawn.

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,160
 Bishop takes f3.

33
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,160
 Pawn move,

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,160
 g takes f3.

35
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,160
 Bishop c5.

36
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
 Queen d2.

37
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,160
 Knight c6.

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,160
 Okay now it's getting tricky, since I don't really have many pawn moves left.

39
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:47,160
 Alright, b4.

40
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,160
 Bishop b6.

41
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
 Long castle.

42
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:00,160
 I mean technically castling is moving two pieces in a row, but you know, let's just ignore that.

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,160
 Queen e7.

44
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
 That blunders a pawn.

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,160
 But of course, it's a pawn move.

46
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,160
 Long castle.

47
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,160
 That blunders a bishop.

48
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,160
 But again, I have to move a piece.

49
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:28,160
 I really want to have a waiting move like bishop g3, but in this position, I believe he wants to go d4, which I think is very dangerous.

50
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,160
 Therefore, I think I need to play aggressively.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,160
 Bishop to g5.

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
 Let's tickle him a little bit.

53
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,160
 Queen takes e5.

54
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
 Wow!

55
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:48,160
 I was expecting f6, but that move is kinda shocking.

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:55,160
 He's baiting me to take his rook, and then he'll go bishop e3, skewering my queen and king.

57
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,160
 This guy is such a grandmaster.

58
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,160
 F4.

59
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:10,160
 Since this guy has baited me to hang my queen, I'm trying to bait him back by blocking my bishop's view to e3, which may get him to blunder bishop e3.

60
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:19,160
 Yeah.

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,160
 F4 is so good that he freezed himself to the end of time.

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
 But anyway.

63
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
 Mission accomplished.

64
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:42,160
