1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 100 rated chess, but I can only make 3 best moves.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 Ah ha! I see what you're trying to do here, Deja Wellner.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 He's trying to make me end my own video.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 Okay then. Let me show you that I know Stockfish like the back of my ex-girlfriend.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 Therefore, let's even change it to...

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 1. If I ever make a best move, the video ends.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 And with that out of the way, let's find an opponent.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 We get a 1 1 6 from... from... somewhere in the world.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 So in order to complete this mission, I think I should stay in theory as long as possible.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 And right at the moment I want to play theoretically, he gave me the Vant Kroeges opening, which I don't even know anything about.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 E5. Stockfish?

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Ah, it's still a book move.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Qh5. Nc6 should be the best move, so let's totally ignore that.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And even though I want to play Nf6 to gambit the pawn, but after Qxe5, Be7 should be a best move, which is bad for the video.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 Therefore, d6. Stockfish?

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Of course.

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 Qb2 d1. Fun fact, that Qb2 d1 is actually a best move according to Stockfish.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 But of course, that doesn't have anything to do with my video.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 So now, Nf6, Nc6, Be6, Bf5, are all good moves, and have some big chances to be the best moves.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Therefore, Be7. There is no way developing a bad bishop by moving it one square can be a best move, right?

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 Yes.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 Bb5 check. Ah ha! Very tricky.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Now c6 should be the best move, so we won't play that, and if I play Nc6, then after Bxc6, Bxc6 is also a best move, which is also bad for the video.

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 Therefore, Be7. Stockfish?

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 Of course.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And furthermore, if he goes Bxc7, I'll go Kxc7, and there is no way that is a best move.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 So he choose to keep the tension.

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Now c6 is once again the best move, so I can also just keep the tension like this.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 But to be honest, I don't really like to play Kxd7.

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 So I guess, Nc6.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And again, I'm not a coward, this is for the video's sake.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 Stockfish?

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 As I predicted.

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Bxc6. Bxc6 should be the best move, therefore, Bxc6.

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 Stockfish?

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Perfection.

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 Nf3. Ah ha! Now e4 is obviously the best move, therefore, Nf6. Such an amazing chance to develop my knight.

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Stockfish?

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Yes. I was so worried that this can also be a best move, but I think Stockfish is trying to be a good friend of mine today.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Ng5. Ah ha!

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Now castle should be the best move, or maybe even Bg4, activating a bishop with a tempo on attacking a queen.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 Therefore, h6. There is no way moving a flank pawn one square can be a best move, right my good friend Stockfish?

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 What the f-

44
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 [Outro]
