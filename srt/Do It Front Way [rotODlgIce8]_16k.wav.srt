 if any piece or pawn is attacked from its back, the video ends. Too easy! We get a 300 rated from

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:19,520
 Canada. e4, knight f6, e5, knight g4 attacking the pawn from behind will end the video,

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:29,440
 but since it's blundering a knight, he's not going to play it. Right? Of course. d3. In no world do

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:41,280
 you play knight f2 to end my video here. Please! Thank god! That blunders a horsey. Ha! Now he

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:51,680
 cannot end my video, no matter how hard he tries. Bishop c5. Ah ha! Now queen g4 is obviously the

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,880
 best move, but that will allow bishop d4 attacking my pawn from behind, which ends the video. So I

7
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:06,640
 guess, knight f3. Now there are 2 pieces guarding the d4 square, so in no world do you move your

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,880
 bishop there. Queen h4. That blunders a queen, but should I even take it though? I have a strong

9
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,040
 feeling, that after I take his queen, he will become extremely crazy and go bishop takes f2,

10
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:30,080
 which attacks my knight on h4 from behind. You know what? I don't believe. Knight takes h4.

11
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,280
 Alright, now just calm down, and don't take anything crazy.

12
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:51,120
 Well, I kinda saw that was coming, so there's no what the f*** today.
