00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 Today is the United States National Short Girl Day.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,000
 Therefore, for today's challenge, if a queen moves further than one square,

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,440
 the video ends. And I'm not gonna explain the reason why.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
 And of course, I cannot capture my opponent's queen,

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,040
 or let my queen die, because it's the girl's day.

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,760
 Let's go. We get a 230 from the US.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,120
 E4. Aha! Right as our first move, there are queen f3, queen g4,

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,360
 and queen h5, ending the video. Knight f6 can prevent 2 of the 3 threats,

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,120
 but after e5, things get really bad for me.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,520
 Therefore, d5. With this move, I can at least stop queen g4, give my

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
 opponent a target, and let's be real, who develops their

12
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,600
 queen first anyway. Right?

13
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,000
 Knight f3. Yes! Bishop g4. Since he blocked away his

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,760
 queen's movement with his knight, pinning the knight down will help keep

15
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,920
 this blocking stuff lasting a bit longer.

16
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,520
 H3. Very aggressive. Bishop h5. Knight g1.

17
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,720
 That blunders a woman, but I cannot take it, due to the rules.

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,600
 Knight f6. Well, at least he still cannot get his queen out right now.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:43,600
 F3. Perfect. I'll take this pawn. Bishop c4. I'll take another pawn.

20
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,280
 G takes. Man, it feels like this guy really wants to lock down his queen to

21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,560
 help my video. But anyway, now d4 allowing queen d3 is

22
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,720
 the threat. Therefore, e5. Well,

23
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:04,160
 unless he plays c3 and unleash a bunch of other threats.

24
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,080
 Ha! He blocked his c-pawn instead. This video is going way much better than I

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,720
 expected. Bishop c5. Let's try to checkmate him

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,360
 fast, before anything weird happens. Knight e2. Wow!

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:28,240
 His queen is stuck now. Man, at this point, people are so gonna say that this guy is

28
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,880
 a paid actor. Bishop takes f3.

29
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,800
 Rook f1. Okay, there has to be some sort of sketchy checkmate right now.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,120
 Knight e4. Fun fact, there wasn't any checkmate,

31
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,640
 and that move was a blunder. My bad.

32
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:56,000
 d3. That blunders a king. And f*** the rules, queen h4 check. And even

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,520
 though I really want to show you guys the entire checkmate,

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,640
 I have to end the video here.

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:18,160
