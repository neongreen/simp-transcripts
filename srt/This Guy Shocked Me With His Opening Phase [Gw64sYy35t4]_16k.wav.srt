1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 100 rated chess, but everyone got a chance.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 All of your pieces, not pawns, must check your opponent's king before they die.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,300
 Not only will they check, checkmate.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:19,060
 We get a 2 26 from somewhere around the world, it seems like chess.com forgot to add the

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,420
 flag for this guy.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,420
 Very racist.

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,420
 E4.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,420
 E5.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,580
 Since I'll have to attack his king a lot.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,300
 King's gambit.

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,040
 King's gambit is risky for my king, but it also creates a lot of initiatives for me to

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,320
 attack his king.

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,260
 Gambit accepted.

14
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,300
 Queen h4 is a threat.

15
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,500
 Knight f3 book move.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,940
 D6 book move.

17
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,480
 D4 book move.

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,700
 This guy is scaring me by continuously making book moves, I'm down to resign if g5 happens

19
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,500
 now.

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,780
 Of course.

21
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,900
 I'll take this pawn.

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,060
 a5.

23
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,940
 That weakens b5 a lot, I'll take this pawn first.

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,700
 D takes e5.

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,940
 Bishop b5 check.

26
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,460
 In case you haven't noticed, this guy hasn't even developed a single piece yet, so bishop

27
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:26,060
 b5 is forcing him to finally make a first piece move.

28
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,460
 Or king.

29
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,140
 Queen trade is legal as that is a check.

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,480
 But I don't like it, knight bd2.

31
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,060
 Rook a6.

32
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,220
 That blunders a rook and a knight, but my bishop is much stronger than his rook, and

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,420
 there is also no reason to waste a move on a horsey that will never be developed.

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,380
 Knight e5 instead.

35
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,780
 I'm starting to feel the tension, let's try to end this quickly.

36
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,340
 Rook e6.

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,660
 Queen f3.

38
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,300
 You may say he's threatening to take my knight which hasn't given a single check yet, but

39
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:08,220
 since his rook is also as active as my knight, who plays like that anyway.

40
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,180
 Right?

41
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,180
 Ha!

42
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,180
 Doubters.

43
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,180
 Long castle.

44
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,220
 f5.

45
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,220
 Knight takes e4.

46
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,740
 Fe4 queen e4.

47
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,300
 Alright, now my setup should be strong enough for a checkmate attack.

48
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:35,180
 So as long as he doesn't make a crazy capture.

49
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,460
 What the f-

50
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:50,040
