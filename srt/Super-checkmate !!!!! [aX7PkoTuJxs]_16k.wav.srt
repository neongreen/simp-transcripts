00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
 100 rated chess, but you must deliver a super checkmate, opponent's king should not be able

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,520
 to escape from checkmate even if his pieces could move twice in a row. So to make it easier for you

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,160
 guys to understand, in this position, queen takes f7 is a super checkmate, because even if his king

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,440
 can take my queen, the dude will still be in check by my light square bishop and there is no way to

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,080
 get out of it, which is to say that his king was actually checkmated twice. Maybe some people still

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:40,640
 haven't understood, but I don't give a shit. We get a 1 47 from India. e4. e5. Still theory. d4.

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,640
 Since I want to super checkmate him, pawns won't have many useful effects, so I would rather let

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:56,800
 them die. Unless he doesn't want to take. Bishop g5. Knight c6. f4. Let's try to be really aggressive.

9
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:06,000
 Knight b4. What is better than having 2 center pawns? Having 3 center pawns. Knight takes e4.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,400
 Ah ha. That blunders a woman, and even though I really don't want to take it because it may cause

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,640
 my opponent to resign, logically speaking, I of course need to remove his queen so my pieces can

12
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:27,040
 have a lot of safe space to move around, so I guess, bishop takes d8. Bishop e7. He wants to

13
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,480
 castle, and I cannot let that happen, so I also have to take this bishop. King takes is kinda

14
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:42,160
 predictable. Bishop c4. Alright, let's try to super checkmate real fast before he decides to resign.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,720
 Knight c3. I'll take that too. And that wasn't such a good idea.

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,760
 You know what? This challenge is absolutely impossible, it is already difficult enough

17
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,960
 just finding a normal checkmate, not to mention about resignation, abandonment,

18
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:13,760
 or running out of time, there is obviously no way I can do this. Have a great day.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,200
