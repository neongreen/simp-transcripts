00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,200
 100 rated chess, but it's the French Revolution, you must en passant 3 times before the game ends,

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,720
 once for each stripe of the flag. Very challenging. E4, I mean since it's all about the Frenchies,

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,880
 it would be amazing if he can play E6 right now going for the French defense.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:29,200
 Ha, what an amazing unpaid not actor. E5. Alright, the setup is complete, now just go D5 or F5,

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,800
 and we have our first stripe of the flag. Okay that blunders a queen, but if I take that queen,

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,960
 he may decide to resign the game, which means the challenge is failed. Therefore, knight F3.

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:52,960
 Queen F5. D4, D5 100%. Wrong pawn. I'll take it, and that was actually really bad,

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,560
 because now there are only 6 pawns that can be en passanted, which means there is almost no room

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:06,320
 for mistake now, considering he'll take back with a pawn after an en passant. Queen G5. That blunders

10
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,560
 the queen again in 2 different ways, so I'll push a pawn, I mean as long as he doesn't go absolutely

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,760
 crazy and take my pawns with his queen, the challenge is still absolutely fine. Queen F4.

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:25,840
 That still blunders the queen, but of course, I'll defend my pawn instead. I can't believe that it

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,280
 can be this hard just to get 1 en passant. Queen takes B4, that blunders the queen for the 3rd move

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,720
 in a row, and even though I'm very mad that he took my pawn, I'm just gonna control myself.

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,280
 Knight C3. He'll take this pawn next, and let's just hope that I can make it with the other 6

16
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:53,680
 pawns alive. Wow! Somehow this guy blundered his queen by taking a defended pawn, and then when

17
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,640
 there is a free pawn waiting for him to capture, he decided that he doesn't want to take it.

18
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:12,160
 G4. Trust me, he doesn't see it. Absolutely. G5. Alright, B5, D5, F5, H5, just please make 1 of

19
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,920
 those moves. He blunders his horsey instead. King E2 is blundering queen C4 checkmate in 1,

20
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,280
 so I have to take it. Well I mean no one resigns after losing a horsey anyway.

21
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:33,200
 Queen E4 check. Wow! That blunders the queen again, but as mentioned before,

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,480
 I can't risk taking it. King D1 is kinda forced. Alright, after all of those queen blunders,

23
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,240
 there is no way he can see queen F3 check and then win my rook.

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,840
 You know what, f*** this game, the challenge was already hard, and then the opponent made

25
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,440
 it absolutely impossible, so I'm just gonna end the video right here, have a great day.

26
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:12,000
