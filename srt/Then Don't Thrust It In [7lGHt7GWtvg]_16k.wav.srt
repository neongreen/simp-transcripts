1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
 100 rated chess, but centralized pieces, or pawns, must not get out.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:12,080
 Open parenthesis, 16 squares, close parenthesis.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,280
 That sounds pretty impossible.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,220
 But you know, a real man doesn't run away from a challenge.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,300
 We get a 275 from Australia.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,920
 For those of you who don't know, the central 16 squares, is this area, which means if a

7
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,040
 piece, or pawn, that steps their feet into this square, must never get out.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,040
 E4.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,040
 E5.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,520
 Still theory.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,000
 And of course, these pawns must never leave this area.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,440
 D4.

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,240
 Since this mission sounds pretty impossible in my perspective, let's just play really

14
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,800
 aggressively and get our victory.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,040
 F6.

16
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:58,960
 Well, this pawn definitely cannot leave the center, but no one said, that it cannot die.

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,740
 F takes E5.

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,740
 That blunders a rook.

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,440
 Oh wait wait wait.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,480
 In this position, there is queen H5 check, G6, queen takes E5 check and then win the

21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,760
 rook, but since the move queen E5 already put the queen in the center, it must not get

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,560
 out of there, which means I cannot take his rook.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
 You know what?

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,440
 I think it's fine, I mean I cannot take his rook, but I'm still hoping for a king move

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,800
 instead of G6.

26
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
 Nevermind.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,680
 I'll still take this pawn.

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,560
 Well, I mean there are still some hopes.

29
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,360
 Ha!

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,960
 You see?

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,480
 Bishop C4 check.

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,120
 There should be a checkmate coming very soon.

33
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,040
 D5 is forced.

34
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,960
 Rook takes D5 check, and let me remind you guys, that these pieces must not get out of

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,560
 this square, unless they die.

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,440
 I'll take with pawn, because this way, I can also prevent knight C6, which attacks my queen

37
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,520
 and also puts another piece into the center.

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,880
 Bishop B4 check.

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,280
 Ah ha!

40
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,760
 A lot of people may say that that move puts the bishop into the square and then take it

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,000
 out, so I'll have to end the video, but know, that bishop actually went to B8, and then

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 change its direction to go to B4.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,320
 And in case you want to argue that no one travels like that, then let me remind you,

44
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,940
 about the ever-given, and the Suez Canal in 2021.

45
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,360
 But anyway.

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,260
 Bishop D2, trading is good for me.

47
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,120
 Bishop back to D6.

48
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,880
 Knight still blunders the rook, but sadly, queen to D4.

49
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,680
 Ah ha!

50
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,320
 Now he finally protects his rook.

51
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:53,960
 Knight F3, I mean knight H5 ends the video, but there's no reason to play such move.

52
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,560
 Right?

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,040
 Of course.

54
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,980
 Bishop E3.

55
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,480
 C5.

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,020
 Very aggressive.

57
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,280
 The French move.

58
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
 Oh, wait.

59
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,320
 Please don't retreat your bishop.

60
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,520
 Ha!

61
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,360
 Not even close.

62
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,040
 That blunders a bishop.

63
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:24,440
 Well I mean that was pretty much his only chance to end my video.

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:37,120
 The F-

65
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,780
 (upbeat music)
