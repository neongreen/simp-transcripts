00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 100 rated chess, but you are very aggressive. If one of your pieces, or pawns, can attack

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,000
 an opponent's piece, or pawn, of greater value. Oh. Wait.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,200
 My bad. It has two. I normally don't take on impossible challenges, but since I won too many

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:27,360
 challenges last week, I mean why not give these ones a try. We get a 170 from the US.

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:36,800
 E4. Before I make the first move, let's make this clear. King, is 3.5. Since I always have to attack

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,760
 what is higher valued, my queen should be my strongest tool in this game, because she's not

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,480
 affected by the rules. Therefore, I'll open up my queen. I mean as long as he doesn't use his queen,

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,160
 things are going to be fine. Okay. I guess things are not going to be fine. That woman is attacking

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,040
 my pawn, but sadly, I have to attack her. I'm sorry Edward, but once again, you have to die

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:10,720
 for the video. Edward is dead. Blocking with my queen is obviously a bad choice because she's my

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,080
 strongest tool, therefore, bishop E7. Oh wait. On second thought, maybe blocking with the queen is

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,360
 better because even though she's my strongest piece, his queen is also his most dangerous threat.

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,920
 Oh well who cares anyway. D4. I really want to castle right now, but sadly, I have to attack

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,640
 the woman. Queen F5. Ah ha, that blunders a rook to knight takes D4 queen F4 knight takes C2 forking

15
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,640
 a king and a rook. But actually, if there is something I can say about the 100 rated players,

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,800
 is that they are very bad at using their rooks. So I guess, D5. No need to take his rook,

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:00,800
 I will try my luck at winning his woman. Queen F4. Okay now I really need to castle, but sadly,

18
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:06,320
 I still have to attack his queen. At this point, I'm sure that unless he pulls his queen all the

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:15,200
 way back, I will never be able to castle in this game. Queen H4. Okay, now comes the real problem.

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,600
 I now have to choose either bishop G3 to attack his queen, which blunders a bishop, or G5 to attack

21
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:30,320
 his queen, which blunders a pawn, probably a knight too. Alright, I've made up my mind. G5,

22
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,880
 I mean there is a chance that he'll take with his queen, which will actually be good for me.

23
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:43,200
 Nevermind. This video is going very wrong very quickly. Bishop E7 is best, but sadly,

24
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:51,920
 bishop G3 is forced. Bishop takes F6. Ah ha, that is actually a bad move because after bishop takes

25
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,400
 H4 bishop takes D8 bishop takes D8, the entire thing will become just an equal trade, but only

26
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,840
 now that I realize, that bishop takes H4 is actually against the rules because the rules

27
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,000
 said if my piece can attack his piece, it has to do so, therefore my bishop needs to stay right here

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 to continue attacking his queen, instead of taking his queen and then there is nothing else to attack.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,960
 So I guess, queen D7. Man I knew that his challenge was really hard, but only now do I realize how

30
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:33,680
 impossible it is. Queen takes G3. Wow. This is really bad. Rook G8 is forced, queen takes G8

31
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:42,000
 is checkmate in one by the way, but there is a chance that he's not gonna do it. Right?

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,560
 Yeah there is no way this is doable.

33
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:59,200
