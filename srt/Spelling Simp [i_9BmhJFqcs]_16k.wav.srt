00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 100 rated chess, but it's a spelling bee, pieces and pawns must be played from correct files in order to create 3+ letter words.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Okay this is obviously impossible considering the fact we can only use 8 out of 26 letters in the alphabet.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 But as I always say, I'm not a coward. We get a 185 from Israel.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 E4. Here's how we're gonna do, we're gonna let our opponent choose the first letter, and then we get to pick the following letters, because if I also get to choose the first letter, the challenge will become too easy.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 D6. Aha, so D is the first letter of our word, and since it is a consonant, we definitely need to follow it. With a vowel, I mean at least we can make the word dab before the video ends.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Qd7. Very aggressive. D4, and there we have it the word dad, but let's not end the word yet, because we don't know what move he's gonna make next.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Qb5. That was a D, so now I have 2 choices, one is to start a new word with a D, the other is to continue the word with an F because I want to take his queen, so of course I went on to Google and search.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Words start with dadf, and here we have the word, dadf. Therefore, Bxb5. Ok I know what you're thinking, what kind of word is dadf, and to be honest, I have absolutely no idea, but since it is in the dictionary, I think we can all agree, that it is still a real word.

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Kd8. Draw offer, but since the video is still so short, let's just decline it for now, and after spending a lot of time researching for words starting with E, I think we only have one choice to make.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 A4. It has to be the word, eej.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 C6. I want to move that bishop, but as I don't know any words starting with EAB.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 Bp6. I'm very sorry Frank.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Frank is dead.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 H4. Alright, let's head to a new word, and to be honest, I think this game has lasted way longer than I expected it to be.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Bxa4. I'll take it, I mean there is no way I can't make a word starting with BA right?

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Bd7. Ah ha, so now I have to make another A if I want to retreat my rook, and since there is a word with BAA,

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
 I can do it. Again, even if you don't know what this word is, the dictionary said that it does exist.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 E5Kf1 D5 Be5. I'm so proud of myself for being able to maintain a good position in such a nasty challenge.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 Dxe4. Bxa7. I mean nothing bad can happen with just D and E right?

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Bb4. Bb6 check. You may say that I'm blundering my rook because there is no way I can make another A if I'll move,

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 but guess what, there are actually a lot of words starting with DEAA, so I actually don't have any worries about it.

22
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 Ke8. Rook takes A8.

23
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 Bb5 check. Ha, exactly as planned.

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 Dxe4. We finished another word, and even though Bxd4 check is very dangerous because I cannot follow a word starting with B,

25
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 he should be able to see, that that move is obviously blundering a checkmate in 13. Right?

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 What the f-

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:59,000
