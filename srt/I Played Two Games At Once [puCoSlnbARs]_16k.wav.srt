1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,320
 100 rated chess, but it is thermodynamic. Every time an irreversible move happens,

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:13,520
 the entropy increases by 1. When the entropy reaches 6, the video ends. The original challenge

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:19,760
 was 12, but that is obviously too easy, so I decided to cut it in half. And now it feels

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:29,040
 impossible. We get a 100 rated American. E4. A pawn move is not reversible, so if I play E5

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,200
 like usual, D3 castling and maybe a C3 should be happening in the near future, which may bring this

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,560
 video to a very dangerous state very early on. Therefore, D5. The plan is very simple,

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,160
 he takes my pawn, I take back with queen, and then he'll be motivated to move his pieces out

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,440
 to attack my queen being exposed in the center of the board. Or not. But that is also very good

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,960
 because I can keep the counting at 2 out of 6, knight F6. Ha, now he has to move his queen,

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:11,520
 and any queen move is obviously reversible. Or not. That blunders a woman, but if I eat that woman,

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,240
 that may provoke G4 and then he'll continue to push pawns until the video ends.

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:24,240
 Well but on second thought, I cannot be a coward. I mean who knows, maybe he'll resign right?

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,080
 Now. Or he can also push a pawn and put this video in great danger.

14
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:38,400
 You know what, I'll take a risk. E6. Only 1 entropy left, but I managed to stop this pawn

15
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,800
 from moving, and he should be able to see, that G4 is blundering a very dangerous queen H4 check.

16
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:56,720
 Right? Ha. Easy game. But instead of mission accomplished, this game was too short to

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,440
 actually make a video, so I decided to play one more game. We get another 100 rated American.

18
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:15,040
 E4. Same plan as before, D5. Aha, now we get a guy that decides to capture, queen takes of course.

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:26,560
 Come at me baby. Bishop C4. Wow. That blunders a bishop, but that will provoke D3 which counts

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,320
 toward the challenge, and if I take this pawn instead, queen F3 will force a queen trade,

21
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,360
 which turns down my plan of using this queen to capture all of the pawns and make sure the

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,200
 challenge won't be broken. I can't believe a blunder can be this confusing. I'll take this.

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:55,280
 I guess I'll just have to accept D3. Nevermind. I also need to prevent castling. Pin. Knight E5

24
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,800
 is an amazing fork. Didn't happen. I once again have to make a decision. If I take this pawn,

25
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,440
 we can eliminate one of the dangerous threats to the video, but then he can castle which is

26
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,800
 also an irreversible move, and if I take his queen, it will prevent castling, but it will

27
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:22,400
 also remove my strongest weapon. I'll take his woman. King takes is forced. Knight C6. Now the

28
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:38,240
 game is officially based on luck. Ha. Another disconnection. Mission accomplished.

29
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:45,680
