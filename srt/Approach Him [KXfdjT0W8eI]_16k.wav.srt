1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
 100 rated chess, but your king is gay and he is attracted to the opponent's king.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,480
 Approach him.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,440
 Sounds absolutely impossible.

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,240
 We get a 158 from Australia.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,440
 Okay so keeping these pieces and pawns at their own position so that I'll never have to move my

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,360
 king should be the best plan for this video.

7
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,480
 But of course, I'm not a coward.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,560
 I'll beat this challenge with my king being a giga chad in the very middle of the board.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,240
 E5.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,520
 Here we go.

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,800
 King e2.

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,440
 All right, as long as there is a square closer to my opponent's king,

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,600
 I'll have to move my king to that square.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,920
 Queen g5.

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
 Very aggressive.

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,360
 e2 to e8 distance is 6 squares, but d3 to e8 is equal to square root 1 squared plus 5 squared,

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,200
 which is smaller than 6.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,280
 Therefore, king d3.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,320
 I mean king f3 also has the same distance,

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
 but there is no way moving the king closer to a queen is a good idea,

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
 especially when he is gay in this game.

22
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,280
 Knight c6.

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
 King c4 is forced.

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,640
 Man, I really need him to play knight f6 right now so I won't have to go to d5.

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,240
 Of course it can't be that convenient.

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,720
 King d5 is forced.

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,000
 All right, now let's just hope that he won't see knight c6 king c4 d5 king d3 d e4 king c3

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,720
 knight d5 king c4 b5 king d5 ishabbi 7 checkmate in 6.

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,240
 Thank god.

30
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,840
 King c4.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,320
 Ha, now my king is a little bit safer, and if he can just play b5 so that I can retreat him

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,120
 even further away, that will help me a lot.

33
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,440
 Or he can just push the same pawn again and force king back to d5.

34
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,000
 This video is going very wrong very quickly.

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,480
 Knight e7.

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,560
 Taking this pawn is best, but sadly, advancing is forced.

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,400
 g6.

38
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:10,240
 Ah ha, now there is queen f6 king c7 is forced due to the challenges rules queen c6 checkmate in 2,

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,280
 so even though this move doesn't bring me closer to his king.

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,960
 King c7.

41
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,640
 To be clear, this move doesn't change the fact that he still has a lot of ways to checkmate me,

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,400
 but the difference is that most of them are only preemptive moves,

43
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,800
 which means those moves don't give a check,

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
 so king c7 will make it harder for him to find those checkmates.

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,720
 b5.

46
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
 Ah ha.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
 Finally.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,200
 Now my king cannot move closer to his king anymore.

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,560
 I can move another thing.

50
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,800
 Bishop a6.

51
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,640
 That blunders a woman.

52
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,800
 f6.

53
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,240
 I'll take that pawn too.

54
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,200
 Man, it's only been 2 moves and he's lost his queen and another pawn.

55
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,040
 Abandonment.

56
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,000
 Mission accomplished.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,500
 "Silence"

58
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:13,140
 "Outro"
