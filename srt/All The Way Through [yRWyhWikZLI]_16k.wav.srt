00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
 100 rated chess, but you are loyal, your king and the enemy queen must not see each other.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,640
 Red heart red heart. I mean this obviously sounds way too easy, so let's just say,

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,000
 that they can see through the other pieces, and I cannot take his queen. Let's go,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,560
 we get a 2 1 4 from the US. With premiumed membership. E3. Ah ha, now there is a very

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:34,160
 dangerous threat of queen H5 ending my video, therefore, H5. I mean there is also queen E2

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:44,880
 ending the video, but who plays like that anyway. Right? Of course. D5. Bishop B5 check. C6. I mean

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,160
 if he can play bishop E2 to block the square away from the queen, that will be very convenient.

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,720
 Man, that was almost very convenient. E5. Well, at least now he should be able to see,

9
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:06,960
 that queen E2 is trapping his own bishop. Right? Knight F3. That blunders a fork. In a perfect

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,320
 world when I can talk to him, I'll just tell him to go bishop E2 and promise that I wouldn't take

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,680
 his knight, but sadly life can never be so convenient. Knight E5. Ah ha, this is a very

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,000
 famous situation where Stockfish probably wants me to go queen G5 knight F7 queen G2 knight H8

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,520
 queen H1 and we just trade rooks but I have a better position, but I absolutely don't like

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,720
 that position because my rook was supposed to defend my H pawn from the queen, so after my rook

15
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,560
 dies, there will be a constant threat of queen H5 ending the video, which is not very attractive.

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,360
 So I guess, queen F6. I mean I will still win a piece after this, and I'm also giving him

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:57,200
 a chance to go bishop E2. Knight takes E4. That blunders a horsey. Well it's actually pretty bad

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:05,680
 because bishop E2 cannot happen anymore, but at least he won't play queen E2 now. Bishop takes E4,

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,920
 queen takes E5. D3. Very aggressive. F5. Of course I'll respond to an aggressive move with an

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:20,560
 aggressive move. And he respond to my aggressive move with another aggressive move. And of course

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:28,560
 I'm not a coward, so it is definitely another aggressive move. Ha, not very aggressive. That

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,160
 blunders a bishop. Well I mean now there are 2 moves to end the video, but there's no reason to

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:43,040
 play any of them now. Right? Of course, E2 is already controlled by my queen, therefore, only

24
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:51,440
 E1 let. Bishop B4. This move temporarily controls the E1 square, and the idea is bishop D2, bishop

25
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,280
 takes D2, queen takes D2 and since his queen is developed above the ground, there is no reason

26
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:05,040
 to bring her back down again. Of course that is also a move. Bishop E7. Doesn't matter, I'll try

27
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,200
 with the other side, and even though G3 can happen, I'll take my chance that he may not decide to play

28
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:24,800
 it. A4. Queen C4, need to keep an eye on E2. E5. Very aggressive. Bishop H4. Queen F3. That blunders

29
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,960
 a rook. Bishop G5, he should be able to see that even though his queen is trapped, there is actually

30
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:39,680
 B3 counterattack queen D3 rook D1 queen C2 queen F1 and he'll only lose a rook. Right? Or he can

31
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,640
 just make a desperado and makes me look like a fool for trapping his queen when I actually cannot

32
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,680
 take her due to the rules. Ha. Nevermind. Mission accomplished.

33
00:03:51,680 --> 00:04:06,400
