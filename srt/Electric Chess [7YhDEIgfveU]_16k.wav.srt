00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
 100 rated chess, but there's electrical engineering, your king is the battery,

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:09,600
 your pieces and pawns cannot move unless they are connected along a chain to the king.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:17,360
 Let's go. We get a 2-46 from Egypt. All of my pieces and pawns are connected to my king,

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:23,600
 so I can move anything, e4. I mean now my e-pawn is not connected to my king anymore,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
 but it cannot move anymore after e5, so it doesn't really matter anyway.

6
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:39,280
 Exactly as planned. Knight c3. Vienna. Knight f6. f4. And I've just realized that I can't

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
 follow the normal line of e f4 e5 because my e-pawn is not connected.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,080
 Nevermind. Knight f3. Everything is now connected again.

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:01:01,680
 d6. I'll take. Bishop g4. That blunders a horsey, and since this pawn is still connected,

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:11,840
 I can take it. g takes f6. d4. Queen e7. Bishop f4 bishop f3 queen f3.

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,600
 b6. It's very hard to connect to this rook as it is literally the end of the electric lines.

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,280
 Rook d1. I'll bring it right next to my king so that even if the line is broken somewhere,

13
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:34,160
 I will still be able to use it. Long castle. Ah ha. This move will be a little bit risky.

14
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:40,800
 But of course, I can not be a coward. This puts my bishop in a very strong square against his king,

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,800
 but it also permanently disconnects my bishop from my king, which means I can never move it again.

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,680
 King d7. This rook is now at the end of the line, so I'll bring him closer. It is actually really

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,920
 weird that my opponent's queen is still alive after 10 moves in the game. Nevermind. That

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,680
 blunders a woman. Man that was convenient. That blunders a very easy to see checkmate in 8 starting

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,200
 with queen g4 check, but that move will disconnect both my queen and my bishop, which makes it

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,720
 absolutely impossible to execute. So I guess, bishop g3. No need to rush, we need a good plan

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:31,440
 first. Knight d4. Ah ha. Now is probably the most important decision of this entire game,

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,240
 and even though I'm obviously not a coward, I just want to tell you that this challenge is

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,280
 much harder than it looks, and it took me a lot of time to finally make this decision.

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,360
 Queen takes f7 check. This permanently disconnects my queen from my king, so I'm

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,960
 currently being put in a situation where I have to quickly checkmate his king, before he can take my

26
00:02:52,960 --> 00:03:02,320
 woman. King c6. And in this position, something unexpected happened. I got disconnected. My

27
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:08,960
 internet connection was actually fine at that point, this is chess.com's fault, I take no responsibility.

28
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:23,840
 *Outro*
