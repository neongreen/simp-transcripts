 100 rated chess, but your piece won't move if there is at least one of your pawns in front of it.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:14,480
 1. Upvote. It's pretty sad, but it's okay, I got you buddy. Okay the plan is obviously to just

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,160
 sacrifice all these useless pawns so that my pieces can move out and play, and the most important

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,160
 piece that needs to move first, is the queen. I mean if he plays E5 right now to let me bring

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,000
 David out of the D file, that will be very convenient. Almost convenient. D5. Of course

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,320
 he'll take. Or not. D takes E6. Alright, now my queen can move, the challenge has become a little

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,680
 bit easier. F takes. Okay, the second most impactful piece should be my light square bishop. Therefore,

8
00:00:50,320 --> 00:01:00,000
 F4. D5. Aha! Change of plan. E4. This way I can sacrifice Edward immediately, and being able to

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,880
 move the king is also not a bad option. Unless he doesn't take the pawn. Bishop F2 check is forcing

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,920
 my king to move, which ends the video, and even though that move doesn't seem very likely to

11
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:19,760
 happen, I'll play it safe. You know what they say, better be safe than pregnant. Queen F6. Man this

12
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,160
 guy just really doesn't want to take any pawns. I'll take then, I mean queen takes F4 is extremely

13
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,160
 dangerous because I cannot take his queen due to the rules, but who plays like that anyway. Right?

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,960
 No doubt. H4, preventing any queen H4 in the future,

15
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,000
 and I mean as long as he doesn't take this pawn, everything is absolutely under control.

16
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,800
 That blunders a woman, but I cannot take it due to the rules, I cannot block with the knight also

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,440
 due to the rules, I cannot move my queen to these squares because that is blundering my bishop,

18
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,160
 I cannot move my bishop because that doesn't make any sense. Therefore, queen D2 is kinda forced.

19
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,640
 Man, this situation is absolutely horrifying, and to be honest, if he finds queen G3 right now,

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:20,000
 I'm down to just FF. Ha! Noob. Queen takes bishop takes king takes. Alright, now the situation is

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,240
 much better, but I'm still only having a bishop to move, so the challenge is still on. G6. Bishop D3.

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:36,960
 E5. Very aggressive. H6, I mean of course he'll take right, there's nothing to think about here.

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:45,360
 Nevermind. That blunders a pawn. Knight takes G6. That blunders a horsey. I mean normal people

24
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,600
 would want their opponent to take here, but I actually prefer to keep my bishop,

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,880
 so if he can let my bishop survive, that will be very convenient. Thank you. Bishop back.

26
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:04,160
 Rook G8 that blunders a pawn bishop E6 G4 bishop G4 knight F3 rook G5 that blunders a rook and

27
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,760
 resignation. Mission accomplished.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:22,500
