 100 rated chess, but pawns cannot capture. So the useless guys are getting even more useless.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:19,520
 For both sides. Let's go. We get a 2-0-1 from India. E4. Aha! Scandinavian is just asking him

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,320
 to end my video, E5 may invite him to play D4, which is also not good for the video, and knight

4
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,720
 C6 is just inviting bishop B5, which forces my knight to move again, since I cannot take back

5
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:42,800
 if he takes my knight. Therefore, B6. Let's get things slow and steady. Knight F3. Bishop B7.

6
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:57,840
 Knight C3. G6. Nothing crazy so far. Bishop C4. Bishop G7. Castle. Aha! He's obviously baiting

7
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,960
 me to go bishop takes C3, thinking that after D takes C3, there is bishop takes E4 winning a pawn,

8
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:13,840
 but he actually has knight G5 D5 F3 bishop takes C2 queen takes D5 queen takes D5 bishop takes D5

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,280
 C6 bishop takes F7 king F8. And it's just an equal trade, but my king cannot castle anymore,

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:30,320
 not to mention that it ends the video from the very beginning. Knight H6. D4. I'll castle.

11
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:39,120
 Knight G5. Very aggressive. Now E6 should be really good, but pushing my center pawns doesn't

12
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:44,960
 seem to be a good idea for the video, not to mention that he can also play D5, which is an

13
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:53,120
 absolute disaster. Therefore, knight A6. Let's just go slowly and wait for him to make mistakes first.

14
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:03,040
 Queen F3. Aha! He's obviously baiting me to go bishop takes D4, which allows him to go queen D3,

15
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,560
 forking my bishop and my knight, and since I cannot take his knight due to the video's sake,

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,560
 I'll have to lose a piece. So I guess, knight F5. Of course he cannot take my knight due to the pin,

17
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,680
 but actually, I think I still have blundered a piece.

18
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,480
 Oh well who cares anyway. As long as my video doesn't end,

19
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,280
 it doesn't really matter how much material I have.

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:41,440
 I can already see that a lot of people are gonna say, "You did that on purpose." But anyway, what the f-
