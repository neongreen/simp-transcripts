00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
 100 rated chess, but the opponent's king is in love with their queen very much,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,280
 their queen must never leave their king's side. It's been a long time since I last

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,960
 take on a luck-based challenge, so why not try our luck today.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:21,120
 E4. Ah ha, that opens up the queen's way, which is very dangerous for the video, therefore,

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,960
 B5. I'm sacrificing this pawn to make him move his bishop instead of his queen,

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,920
 which is by the way, the distraction strategy. Or he can also not move the queen and not take

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,360
 the pawn at the same time. That horsey already blocks the queen's way to end the video,

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:49,680
 therefore, I guess I'll keep this pawn. Knight C3, bishop B7. D4. Ah ha, that opens up queen D3

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,760
 ending the video, so I guess, B4. I mean if I attack his knight, he won't have time to move

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:06,000
 his queen. Right? Of course. E6. Again, I'm attacking his knight, no worries about the video.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,760
 Knight takes B4. That blunders a horsey, but do I even take it though, because if I take it,

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,280
 he'll most likely place E3 to block the check, which opens up this very dangerous diagonal for

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:27,280
 his queen to end the video. Well, as always, I'm not a coward. I mean who knows, maybe he'll block

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,000
 with his bishop instead and his queen can never even go to D3 to end the video. Nevermind. Pulling

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,640
 this way is only provoking queen A4, so I have to go this way. Bishop G5. That blunders a horsey.

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,880
 Bishop takes knight takes queen takes. Please resign. F3. You know what? I have an idea.

17
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:59,760
 Queen E3 check. Alright, please block with your woman. Perfect. Of course I cannot trade queens

18
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,240
 because his queen in heaven cannot be considered as by his king's side. Queen back to G5. My plan

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,600
 is very simple, I made him move his queen once, so it will reduce the chance that he'll move his

20
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:17,600
 queen again to end the video, because as the grandmasters always say, don't move a piece too

21
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:26,240
 many times in a row. What the f-

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:40,720
