00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 100 rated chess, but the enemy queen is an ice queen, all of your pieces, or pawns, in the line of sight of the queen, cannot move.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 Well, the idea sounds pretty cool, but sadly, I don't know what an ice queen means, so let's just change it to... Medusa.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Let's go, we get a 2-1-0 American. With premiumed membership.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 D4. Ah ha, I was afraid that he would go E4 and queen out causing terror, but D4 really doesn't do anything harmful to my video.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Knight F6, and by the way, according to the rules, everything that I have in his queen's sight, must not move.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 E4. That blunders a pawn, of course a move like queen F3 will be very problematic because I won't be able to move my knight anymore, but you know, who develops their queen first anyway. Right?

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 Of course. Knight back to F6.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 G4. Very aggressive.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 H6, of course I cannot let him push G5.

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 Nevermind. I'll take it.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And he doesn't even take back.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Alright then, I'll take this as well. This guy has been blundering 3 pawns within 6 moves, and I solemnly swear, that he's not a paid actor.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 Bishop G5.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 B6, well at least he won't blunder any pawns in this position.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 And then he blunders a bishop instead.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 G5, such a wonderful unpaid actor.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Bishop takes G5. That blunders a rook.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 Oh wait wait wait. If I take his rook, my rook will be within his queen's sight, which means I cannot move my rook anymore, so it can even be considered as a rook trade.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 But on second thought, it's not like I have any other choices anyway.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Rook takes H1. Now my rook cannot move, unless he moves his queen away.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 Bishop takes F6. He takes F6.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 Knight E2. Bishop A6.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 Knight F4. Ah ha, that blunders a bishop and a woman, but my rook cannot move, according to the rules.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 So I guess, bishop takes F8. And of course, now my bishop also cannot move.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Man, this mission is going very wrong very quickly.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:51,000
 Knight D5. Very aggressive. I have a big feeling that he's about to blunder knight takes C7 check, but since my queen cannot move, I won't be able to take his knight, which means I'll have to advance my king instead.

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 Therefore, knight A6. You know what they say, better be safe than pregnant.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Queen D3. Ah ha, now the game truly begins. And then it ends at the same time.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 Wow. I couldn't even say that it blunders the medusa but my bishop cannot move due to the rules.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Anyway. Mission, accomplished.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:33,000
