 It is the United States National Guy Day, and as a real man that is arguably a lot more manly than my viewers.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 100 rated chess, but the women don't move.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 You may want to ask why am I taking on such an impossible challenge like this, and the answer is obviously...

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Testosterone. We get a 133 from France.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 E4. Queen h5 is very likely happening next, so at least I'll try to prevent it.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 I mean he still has queen f3, but a lot of people don't tend to do that very often.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Bishop c4.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Ah ha. Now the queen f3 threat is even more obvious than before, therefore I have no other choice, but to sacrifice this pawn.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 Why is he thinking for so long?

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Ha! Doubters.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Bishop b7. I mean queen f3 is also an option to defend his e-pawn, but who puts their queen straight into enemy bishop's attack anyway.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 Right?

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
 This guy is very strong.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 Knight f6. Some people may say that this is a bad move as it provokes queen e2, but I do have faith that he's not gonna make such an unhuman move.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 Right?

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Of course. But that blunders a pawn.

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Knight takes e4. Bishop takes e4.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
 Ha! Now I have completely stopped the queen f3 threat, and even better, he actually cannot make a queen move in this position without blundering his rook,

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 and after knight f3 or pawn f3, his queen will be boxed inside his territory, and the video shall continue for a very long time.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 What the f-
