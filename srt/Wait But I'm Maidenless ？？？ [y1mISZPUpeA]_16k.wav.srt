00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
 100 rated chess, but you're a wingman for your opponent, you must help your opponent

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,960
 promote a pawn to a queen before checkmate. Okay so I don't think anyone would want to

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,720
 help their opponent in an intimate relationship, but for the video's sake, I guess we can make an

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:24,720
 exception this time, we get a 145 that needs a new wife from Luxembourg. E4. I mean after all of

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,320
 those crazy hard challenges, this easy one is definitely going to give me a relaxing game.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:39,360
 D5. Ah ha, normally I would have taken that pawn, but just for this game. C4. Alright,

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,760
 2 choices, there is no way he's not taking one of them. Very convenient.

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,720
 B3. I mean since he took it last time, there is no way he's refusing it this time. Right?

9
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,280
 Absolutely. Man, this game has been going so well until now, and as far as I can remember,

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,600
 those games that went smoothly in the beginning, usually don't end up good for me.

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:13,520
 Bc4. Alright, now I'm having 2 pieces attacking his pawn, so may as well just take something

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,640
 before it dies, and this may sound rude but I don't believe that he can see Qd4 Qb3 Qa1 Bf7

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,640
 Kd8 Bg8 winning in exchange. Or he can just not take the pawn and not make the queen fork at the

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:40,320
 same time. Nf3. Nd4. Ah ha, now he finally sees the queen fork and is trying to get Nxd4 Qxd4,

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,880
 but of course, I cannot allow that. Nxf3 check. Qx, I'm setting things up first for a quick

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:58,560
 checkmate right after he can have his new woman. Bxa2. Ah ha, that blunders a king to Qf7 Kd7 Qf5

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,320
 Kc6 Qb5 Kd6 e5 a very well-known checkmate in 4 with a pawn, but sadly, I cannot do that before

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:18,320
 he has a new queen. e5, no way he's not taking it this time. Random move. d3. It's fine, I mean how

19
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,040
 hard can it be for a chess player to make a new queen when their opponent is obviously provoking

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:39,680
 it to happen anyway. Why is he thinking for so long? What the f-
