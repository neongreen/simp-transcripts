1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,780
 If a piece, not a pawn, lands on the F file,

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:14,440
 Simp says what the F*CK, playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,840
 Also, the starting position, doesn't count.

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,440
 Right.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,260
 I believe this video is going to be unbelievably short.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,800
 But still, I kinda ran out of ideas.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,480
 Therefore, let's find an opponent.

8
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,960
 We get a 1 56 from India.

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,500
 Great.

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,540
 An impossible challenge.

11
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,980
 And an impossible opponent.

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:48,560
 This should have been a chess impossible episode.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,240
 But anyway.

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,900
 First move, it's kinda obvious that knight F3 is the biggest threat.

15
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,640
 But of course, there's nothing I can do about it.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,840
 You know, since he moves first.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,960
 Therefore, let's just sit here and wait for my destiny.

18
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,060
 E3.

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,060
 Not very aggressive.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,280
 And of course, knight F3 is still the biggest threat.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,540
 I mean queen F3 is also a threat.

22
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,240
 But you know, who the hell moves their queen first anyway.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,080
 So I guess, D4.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,560
 I'm planning to go bishop H3.

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,600
 Sacrificing my bishop to deflect his knight away from the F file.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,320
 Knight C3.

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,140
 Thank you.

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,760
 Bishop H3.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,680
 Of course he'll take this way right?

30
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,340
 Man.

31
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,740
 The video hasn't even reached 2 minutes yet.

32
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,060
 And since this video is so short.

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:08,740
 I think maybe I should reveal my real voice, saying what the F*CK.

34
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,920
 Okay, on second thought.

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,340
 Maybe it's not the time yet.

36
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,920
 So I guess.

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,280
 What the F*CK.

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:32,780
