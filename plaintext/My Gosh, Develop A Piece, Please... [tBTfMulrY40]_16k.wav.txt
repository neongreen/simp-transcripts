 [Music]  You're a stupid child  You chase your dreams and get hurt  You're bad at lying  But you show me a smile that doesn't make me laugh  You're bad at saying "I love you"  You're really clumsy  But why did you say "goodbye"?  You're no good, no good, no good  You're too dark and too innocent  No matter how strong the alcohol  Memories that don't waver  You're a stupid child  You're a stupid child, really stupid  You just believe  You pretend to be a strong woman  And bathe in the night wind of sadness  Three years have passed since you became alone  Even the cityscape has changed  You left only regrets in the window  You're a really bad man  I'll take off your ring  I'll make a fuss  I'm waiting for you  You're a stupid child  [Music]  You're no good, no good, no good  You're too dark and too innocent  No matter how strong the alcohol
