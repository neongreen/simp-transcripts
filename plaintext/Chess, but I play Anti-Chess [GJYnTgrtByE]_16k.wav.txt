 100 rated chess. But you have to take any pieces or pawns when it is possible for you to do so.  Well, this is obviously going to be a total disaster. But again, I can't argue with money.  Therefore, let's find an opponent.  We get a 268 from Australia.  E4.  E5.  So far so good, as long as he doesn't play such an absurd move like A3, forces bishop takes A3.  D3.  Very solid.  Nc6.  I can already see a lot of you guys are going to say, oh you should have played d6, since it stops the bishop from seeing A3.  Well, that's right, but I don't think he's going to play that move, so there's no need to do such thing.  G4.  Very aggressive.  He's obviously threatening to go G5, forcing queen takes G5, which blunders a woman.  Therefore, H6.  H4.  You know what?  I'm just going to end this video here. I don't want to play this game anymore, sayonara, see you tomorrow.  [Music]
