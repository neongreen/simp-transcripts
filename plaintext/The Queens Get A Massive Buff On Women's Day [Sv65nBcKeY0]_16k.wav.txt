 It's pretty obvious that this is losing for white, even the engine says that there's mate  in 10 for black. White desperately moves his queen and captures on f5. Now it's black to  move. But since it's women's day, and all of black's pieces are simps, they refuse to  move against white's queen and let her take everything instead.  [music]  This is a check. Normally, black's king can take the queen and the game is a draw, but  since he is also a simp, he willingly left the board to give the woman the victory.
