 [Music]  You're a stupid child, chasing your dreams and getting hurt  You're a bad liar, but you showed me a smile that couldn't be laughed at  You don't even say "I love you" well, you're really clumsy with your words  But, but why did you say "goodbye"?  You're no good, no good, no good  I love you, I love you too much  No matter how strong the alcohol is  Memories that don't waver, like an idiot  [Music]  You're like an idiot, really an idiot  You only believe  You pretend to be a strong woman  You bathe in the night wind of sadness  Three years have passed since I became alone  Even the cityscape has changed  you
