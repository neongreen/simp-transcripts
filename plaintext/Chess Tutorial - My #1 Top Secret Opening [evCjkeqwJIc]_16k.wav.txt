 Hello everyone, today I'm gonna show you guys my number 1, top secret opening, that  helped me climb from 1600 rating points, to 600 rating points on chess.com.  We'll start the game with E4, opponent responds D5.  This is called the Scandinavian defense.  We'll take the pawn.  Opponent took back.  Then we go king to E2.  Now if you look to the right, you can see the opening's name has changed to simping  king opening.  Let's continue with the main line.  Opponent checkmates you, and now you win.  (La la la la la la la la)
