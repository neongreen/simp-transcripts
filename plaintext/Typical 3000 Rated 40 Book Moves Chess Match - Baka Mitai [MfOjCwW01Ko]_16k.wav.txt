 [Music]  You're a stupid child, chasing your dreams and getting hurt  You're a bad liar, but you can't smile  You don't even say "I love you" well, you're really clumsy  But, but why did you say "goodbye"?  You're no good, no good, no good  I love you, I love you too much  No matter how strong the alcohol  Memories are like a fool  [Music]
