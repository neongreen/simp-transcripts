 [Music]  You're a stupid child  You chased your dreams and got hurt  You're bad at lying  But you showed me a smile that couldn't be laughed at  You're bad at saying "I love you"  You're really clumsy  But, but why  Did you say "goodbye"?  You're no good, no good, no good  I love you, I love you too much  No matter how much I drink  My memories don't change  You're a stupid child  You're a stupid child, really stupid  You only believe  You pretend to be a strong woman  You bathe in the night wind of sadness  Three years have passed since you became alone  You even changed the cityscape  You left behind the city of tears  You're a really bad man  I'll take off your ring  I'll make you pay for it  I'm waiting for you  You're a stupid child  (epic fanfare music)
