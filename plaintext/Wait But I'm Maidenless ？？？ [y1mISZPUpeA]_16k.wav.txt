 100 rated chess, but you're a wingman for your opponent, you must help your opponent  promote a pawn to a queen before checkmate. Okay so I don't think anyone would want to  help their opponent in an intimate relationship, but for the video's sake, I guess we can make an  exception this time, we get a 145 that needs a new wife from Luxembourg.
