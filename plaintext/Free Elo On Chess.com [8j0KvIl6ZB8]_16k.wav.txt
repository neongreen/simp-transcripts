 So I was 1599 rapid rated in chess.com.  There comes the question.  How can I get to 1600?  I mean queuing into a game is too much of a risk.  So here is what I did.  I opened the live chess settings, and changed the outgoing range to -25 to +400.  Then I queued for a match.  We got d4,  d5,  bishop f4.  And I offered a draw.  Mouse slipped.  Well of course, I didn't mouse slipped into a London system, just wanted the free draw.  At first, he declined the draw so fast that he couldn't read my chat.  But then the nice guy offered back the draw.  And since his elo was way higher than mine, a draw is a +1 for me.
