 100 rated chess, but it's rushy. You may only play moves to and from the E-file.  Very difficult, but nothing is impossible. We get a 100 rated Brazilian.  E4. A move that is from the E-file and also to the E-file, is definitely following the rules.  E5. I mean he doesn't have to follow the rules, but I respect it.  Bishop E2. I actually wanted bishop C4, but as bishop from F1 to C4 is not connecting with the  E-file, I need to move him to E2 first, and then continue from E2 to C4. Knight C6. Bishop C4.  D6. Since I obviously cannot move any pawns, now I can only choose to move something between my  queen and my knight. And I'll choose my queen. Queen E7. I wanted to go queen F3 aiming for a  scholar checkmate, but since his queen is already defending his F-pawn. Queen E3 instead. Since I  can only use my light bishop, my queen will help with controlling the dark squares. Bishop E6.  Ah ha. I can take his bishop as it is standing on the E-file, but as I only have so many pieces  to play with. Trading is definitely not a good idea. King D8. Ha. I bet that was a failed attempt  to castle his king, so even though I really want to castle right now to flex that I can play the  move. Bishop F3 first. I need to move my knight first, and then when I can finally show him the  proper way to castle, he'll probably cry while realizing that I'm actually much better than him,  and then decide to run away with a resignation. Or I don't even have to do that.  This guy was so mad at the fact that he cannot perform the move, so he resigned.  But anyway, mission accomplished.  [Music]
