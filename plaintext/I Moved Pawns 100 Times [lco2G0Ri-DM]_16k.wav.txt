 100 rated chess, but if your opponent moves a piece, you move a pawn, and vice versa.  Sounds fun. We get a 137 from Brazil.  E4. That's a pawn move, so I have to move a piece.  Queen h5 check. Very aggressive. Queen is also a piece, therefore, g6.  Queen c5. E5 is obviously the best move.

Aha! Finally.  Bishop e6. Okay. Come on. Just one more pawn move, and I can finally get rid of this dangerous horsey.  What the f-  [Music]
