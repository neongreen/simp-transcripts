 If a piece, not pawn, doesn't protect anything, the video is unprotected.  Playing 3 minute splits on a 100 rated account. Let's go, we get a 1 17 from Canada.  So now the most obvious threats are pushing the center pawns, because a move like e4 will  make his g1 knight not protect anything, which means it ends the video.
