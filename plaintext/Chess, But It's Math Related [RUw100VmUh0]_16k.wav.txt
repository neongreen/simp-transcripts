 If two consecutive moves of one player are of the same vector, the video ends.  So in term of comparing two vectors, there are two things, called magnitude, and direction.  But who cares, all you need to do, is just to watch the video, and I will show you all  of the moves that can end the video during the game.  We get a 2.56 from the US.  With premium membership.  E4.  Since the first move is E4, the video is going to end if my opponent plays D4, C4, B4, or  any of these moves, on his next move.  Therefore, D5.

Therefore, knight takes D5.  Go back to D1 please.  And the best thing is, after queen D3 or queen D1, there is actually no move that can end  the video.  What the f-  [music]  [music]
