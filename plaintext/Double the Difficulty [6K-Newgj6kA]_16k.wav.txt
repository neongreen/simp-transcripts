 100 rated chess, but you're running low on fuel, you can only move 4 times, but you gain  1 additional move for every point of material you capture.  Giving me 2 additional moves was way too many to use, and quite frankly, turning 2 to 1  is still very easy.  We get a very angry guy from Iceland.  E4.  E5.  Qh5.  Nc6.  Nothing wrong so far, except the fact that I only have 2 moves until the video ends.  Bc4.  Alright, g6 is the most popular move right now, but that will make this video absolutely  impossible as I cannot capture anything to raise the move limit.  Therefore, Qf6 instead.  Qxf7 will be very convenient.  Sadly he's not a paid actor.  I have to raise the move limit right now, and the only option is, Qxf3.  +3 baby.  Gxf3.  G6.  It's fine, a real man doesn't need a woman in his life.  And my opponent agrees.  That is very convenient.  Now since I have a lot of moves, I think we can already see an easy victory in this game.  F4.  3 more moves.  These challenges get really convenient sometimes.  D3 knight back knight a3 bishop takes pawn takes d5 e d5 knight e5 rook g1 knight f6  f5 that blunders a pawn bishop h6.  He'll have to castle the other way, knight g4.  Attacking the bishop and also preparing the knight for a free f-pawn.  Bishop g7.  Very aggressive.  Rook g8.  Bishop b2.  Strong castle.  If I castle, he'll castle.  Absolutely.  That blunders a pawn.  Rook d2.  Knight h3.  I feel like I'm wasting too many moves on this useless horsey.  Rook g3.  Rook e8.  Only 6 moves left, guess I'll have to find a way to trade down a rook.  Nevermind.  +5 baby.  How about blundering the other rook too.  I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor.  Rook takes e2.  c4.  Knight e3.  Checkmate incoming.  Or not.  Mission accomplished.  Thanks for watching.
