 Chess, but you play against bot.  Great idea, but of course, I have to add something to make it a challenge.  Let's say, I have to win, without losing any material.  Let's go.  I chose Harry Mack as my opponent, and for anyone who don't know, Harry Mack is an artist,  and is a participant of PogChamp 4.  E4.  Since I can't afford to let any pieces die, pushing center pawns seems a bit too risky.  Therefore, knight C6.  Knight F3.  B6.  Bishop C4.  Bishop B7.  Nothing wrong so far.  Knight G5.  Oh, here it comes.  E6.  Queen H5.  Knight E5.  Oh, wait.  I blundered.  Now he has knight takes E6, D takes E6, queen takes E5, winning a pawn, and end the video.  My bad.  Haha, of course a 600 rated engine cannot see it.  G6.  G4.  That blunders a queen.  But if I take his queen, it will turn out that I have a double attack on his knight  and bishop, which may cause him to make a desperado.  So I guess, I'll take the bishop.  A3.  That blunders the queen again.  Chess.com, I believe you guys should try to fix this engine, since I don't think Mack  is going to abandon his woman, twice.  But again, should I even take it though, since there is also G takes H5, and even though  that blunders the horsey, I mean he blundered his queen twice, so the horsey is nothing  much.  Yeah, I think that is still too risky.  Knight F6.  Alright, now there are 2 pieces attacking his queen, of course he'll move it.  Right?  What the f-  (Outro music)
