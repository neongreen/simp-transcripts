 100 rated chess, but your every third move has to be a blunder? According to Stockfish.  Man, I don't know why so many people reacted to this idea, but it's kinda obvious,  that this video is not going to last long. We get a 281 from Netherlands.  H3. Aha, long time no see, the Clemens opening. E5.  G3. Not very aggressive. D5. F3. Alright, as much as I hate it,  the third move has come, and as the rule requested, this has to be a blunder. Therefore,  Bishop takes H3, but not yet, I still have to check if Stockfish thinks that it's a blunder.  Thank you. E3. Wow, don't tell me that he's also doing some stupid challenge like I am.  Bishop back to E6, well at least that helps me save a piece. D3. Knight C6. C3. Three moves went  by real fast. And again, Bishop back to H3. Stockfish? Of course. B3. Bishop back to E6 again.  A3. Knight F6. Ha, now all pawns are forward, I wonder what he's going to do now. Another pawn  push. I solemnly swear, that this guy is not a paid actor. But anyway. A blunder is forced.  Stockfish? Yes. And I mean since he didn't take my Bishop the last 2 times, he won't take it this  time, right? Wow. That's weird. D4. Congratulations to myself, the video has officially got past move  10. Well unless he resigns right now. C takes D4. E takes D4. E takes D4. I really want to take this  pawn, but sadly, a blunder is forced. Stockfish? Thank you. Castle. D5. Very aggressive. I'll take  it. Queen takes B7. Again, very aggressive. That move blunders a piece to Qe8. Check King F2. Rook  B8. Qe6. Rook takes B1. But sadly, a blunder is forced. I'm blundering my knight on C6, but since  he's already up 4 points in materials, I have a feeling that Stockfish is not going to think that  it is a blunder. Yeah. I saw that was coming.  [Music]
