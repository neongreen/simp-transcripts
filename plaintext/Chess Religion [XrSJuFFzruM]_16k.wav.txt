 100 rated chess, but you are religious, you need to promote 3 or more pawns into bishops,  you cannot let any bishops die, and every piece, not pawn, has to visit your bishops before they  die. The last part just doesn't make any sense, so I'll say that we'll just gonna delete away  that entire section. And I'm not a coward. We get a 1 34 from Argentina. Ha, I'm very sorry  about your defeat against Saudi Arabia. E4. E5. Still theory. D4. Since the challenge doesn't  allow me to trade down my bishops, the best plan is obviously to quickly open up the board,  and then give my bishops a lot of activity without having to move them around for too many times.

I'm trapping my own rook to  somewhat make him feel better after losing his woman. And in no world do you play bishop F2 right  now. I'm worrying too much. C4. Alright, now we know that he's not the type of player who  just randomly resigned from the game, I'm down to say that this challenge is definitely a success.  What the f-  [Music]
