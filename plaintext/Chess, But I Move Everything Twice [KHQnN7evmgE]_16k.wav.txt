 100 rated chess, but on every second move, you must move the same piece, or pawn, you  moved on the previous move.  Ok then.  We get a 1 8 e 9 from Canada.  Let's be real, this is 100% not doable.  But of course, I'll still try my best.  And to be honest, I only hope that I won't be checkmated too early.  e 4.  e oh wait wait wait.  If I play e 5, I won't be able to move my e pawn again next turn, because his pawn is  already blocking the way.  And if you really think about it, this first move is actually harder than it looks.  Let's see.  e 6 also doesn't work, because if he just pushes e 5, my e pawn is once again.  Trapped.  Pushing the d pawn is just provoking bishop b 5 check, which also prevents me from moving  it again.  Developing a knight also doesn't work, because since I have to move my knight again, it's  most likely going to jump around for a while.  And if I push another pawn, for example, c 6, queen h 5, c 5 is forced, bishop c 4, g  6, queen f 3, g 5 is forced, and I get checkmated by a bishop.  So I guess.  g 6.  I mean this is the only way to prevent queen h 5, or at least just delay it for one move.  Knight f 3.  Ah ha.  He's obviously trying to prevent me from pushing g 5.  But guess what?  g 5 is forced.  Ha ha, you didn't stop anything, noob.  Well of course that's a free pawn.  This mission is getting out of control really quickly.  But anyway.  That knight is actually really annoying.  Therefore, e 6.  Well, technically, if he just plays knight back to f 3, e 5 is forced, and then I'll  lose another pawn.  What is wrong with this mission by the way?  Queen f 3.  That blunders a horsey.  But e 5 is forced.  But that's blundering a king.  Are you serious?  Well, at least I tried.
