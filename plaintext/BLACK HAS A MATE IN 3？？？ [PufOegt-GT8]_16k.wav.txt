 If I'm playing black, this is a pretty scary situation. White goes first ahead and plays  rook to d8. Because apparently, that is the only legal move. Black then goes knight to h6.  Now this guy wants to go ahead and make himself a queen. But then the white king said that he had  too many queens in his house already. So he forced the dude to become a rook instead.  Sadge. Black then goes knight to f5, continue to take away one more white king's woman.  White then goes knight to g7, wanting to make a new  rook. But then black captured on e3, and white's king is now smothered checkmated after losing  three of his wives. Losing queens is not good. Now please like and subscribe.
