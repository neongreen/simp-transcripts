 100 rated chess, but you love clash royale update. You must collect 15 points of material before you  can move your queen. I still remember in one of my past videos I mentioned that I didn't know what  clash royale is, but this time, I still don't know what it is. We get a 100 rated guy from India.  E4. I mean I can technically play without a queen against a 100 rated opponent,  but that will ruin the purpose of the video. Therefore, let's say I have to checkmate my  opponent with my queen. G6.

No en passant for you, that move is definitely not forced.  Knight G5. Free horsey. 3 down, 12 more to go. E6 please. Not a paid actor. C3. B6. F4.  Bishop B7. That blunders a pawn. I mean even though I cannot move my queen, he should be able  to see, that G takes F5 is very obviously blundering queen H5 checkmate in 1. Right?  Brilliant move by the way. That blunders a king, but of course, I cannot do that. I mean at least  the challenge said I only have to capture 15 points of materials, not being up 15 points of  materials, so that bishop didn't decrease my counting. E6. Very convenient. 14 down,  1 pawn more and this challenge is a success.  What the f-  [Music]
