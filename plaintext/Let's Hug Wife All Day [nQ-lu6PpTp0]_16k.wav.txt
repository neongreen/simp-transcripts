 100 rated chess, but the royal couple and the peasants must stay together, the king and queen  always have to be touching, and all the pawns also always have to be touching. I personally don't  think this is very interesting, but since a lot of people reacted to this one, maybe there is  something that I'm missing. We get a 168 from Spain. E4.

I'll take that pawn now, and he should be able to see  that knight takes C7 is just blundering a horsey. Right? Yes. These 3 pieces are scaring me to  death right now, therefore, let's try to trade some of them down. Please just don't go crazy  and take any of these pawns, because if there is just 1 pawn being taken away, the rest of the  pawns will be disconnected, except if that pawn was Hikaru, or Anish. Bishop trade. E takes is  just ending my own video, therefore, knight takes is kinda forced. And even better, now it's very  clear that my queen is defending both of these pawns. What the f-  [Music]
