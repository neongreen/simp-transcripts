 [Music]  I love you  I don't say it well  I'm really clumsy with my words  But, but why  Did I say goodbye?  No, no, no, no, no  I love you so much  No matter how strong the alcohol  It's a distorted memory  I'm a fool  I'm a fool, really a fool  I just believe in you  I pretend to be a strong woman  I bathe in the night wind of sadness  Three years have passed since I became alone  Even the cityscape has changed  But, but why  Did I leave only regrets?  I'm a really bad man  I'll take off the ring of love  I'll make a fuss  I'm a fool, waiting for you  [Music]  No, no, no, no, no  (heavy breathing)
