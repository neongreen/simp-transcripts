 [Music]  You're a stupid child, chasing your dreams and getting hurt  You're a bad liar, but you showed me a smile that couldn't be laughed at  You don't even say "I love you" well, you're really clumsy  But, but why did you say "goodbye"?  You're no good, no good, no good  I love you, I love you too much  No matter how strong the alcohol is  Memories that don't waver, like a fool  [Music]  You're a fool, really a fool  You only believe  Pretending to be a strong woman, you bathe in the night wind of sadness  Three years have passed since I became alone  The town has changed  I left only regrets that I had forgotten  You're a really bad man  I'll take off your ring of love  I'll punish you  You're a fool, waiting for an excuse  You're no good, no good, no good  I love you, I love you too much  No matter how strong the alcohol is
