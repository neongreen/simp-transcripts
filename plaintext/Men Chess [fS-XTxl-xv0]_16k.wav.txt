I mean queen f3 is also an option to defend his e-pawn, but who puts their queen straight into enemy bishop's attack anyway.  Right?  This guy is very strong.  Knight f6. Some people may say that this is a bad move as it provokes queen e2, but I do have faith that he's not gonna make such an unhuman move.  Right?  Of course. But that blunders a pawn.  Knight takes e4. Bishop takes e4.  Ha!
