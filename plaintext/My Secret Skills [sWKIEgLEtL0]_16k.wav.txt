 100 rated chess, but you had way too much caffeine, every 5 moves you go afk to have  explosive diarrhea.  Let's say, 2 minutes.  You may be wondering why it takes me so fast to carry out such thing, let's just say I  have some secret skills.  We get a 1 0 5 from the Philippines.  E4.  The plan is very simple.  If I have to afk 2 minutes every 5 moves, I technically only have 10 moves to finish  this game.  Therefore, let's try to do it in 5.  E5.  Bishop C4.  A light square bishop is definitely one of the strongest weapons against a black king.  G6.  Ah ha.  What a coward.  He's obviously trying to prevent queen H5, so if I play queen F3 right now, he will most  likely be able to see the threat immediately and prevent it from happening.  So I guess, D4.  He takes D4.  I'll develop my queen this way.  It's gonna be hard to think about a quick checkmate, but there is no problem to think  about a quick free rook.  Or bishop.  Queen takes G7.  Knight E7.  Ah ha.  That blunder's a king, but according to the mission, I have to go afk after 5 moves, and  now since 5 moves have passed, I'll answer some of your comments during the free time.  I obviously definitely really don't like ads, but I love your videos, heart heart heart.  But I like ads, so I don't like you.  Can't comprehend the incomprehensible.  I'm not a chat.  Coward.  You would want to be white to actually win this challenge.  This challenge said that I needed to impress my Asian parents, and if you think I can do  that just by switching sides, I can easily tell that you're not an Asian and don't have  any Asian friends.  Resignation.  Mission.  Accomplished.  [Outro Music]
