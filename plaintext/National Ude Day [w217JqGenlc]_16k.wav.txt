 It's the 14th of July, aka the United States National N*** Day.  And yes I also cannot believe YouTube demonetizes a word that is used for a national holiday.  But anyway.  100 rated chess, but opponent's queen doesn't have clothes on,  my pieces and pawns must not look at her.  Sounds easy enough.  We get a 1-0-3 from Greece.  E4.
